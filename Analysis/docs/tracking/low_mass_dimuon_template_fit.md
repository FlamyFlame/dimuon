# Low-mass dimuon template fit (OS/SS minv 0–4 GeV + Pythia truth templates)

**Mode:** Implementation. **Created:** 2026-06-18. **Session:** "template fit prep".
**Reviewer rules:** RDF/C++ code → `/review-analysis-code`; plots/fits → `/review-plot`.
**Siblings:** `analysis_overview.md` (§2,§4), `reco_eff_placeholder_run2.md` (Q1 dσ
weights), `raa_from_rdf_crossx.md` (OS−SS methodology), `project_overlay_pair_structure`,

## Objective
Build the ingredients for a template fit of the **low-mass (0–4 GeV) opposite-sign
dimuon mass spectrum** to separate the **single-b signal** from the **gluon-splitting
(open-HF) background** and the **uncorrelated combinatoric** background, using the
same-sign spectrum to constrain the combinatoric and **Pythia evgen truth** minv
templates (split by flavor/origin category) for the correlated components. POWHEG
is intentionally excluded for now (NLO template biased against g→QQ̄ — see
`project_mc_sample_roles`).

First concrete deliverable (this cycle): add **efficiency-corrected,
crossx-normalized OS and SS minv histograms over 0–4 GeV with the dimuon
mass-window cut REMOVED** (other single-b kinematic cuts kept), for pp and PbPb.
These are the data inputs `D_OS(m)`, `D_SS(m)` of the fit.

**Umbrella scope (added 2026-06-21).** This doc is the authoritative plan for the
**full background-subtraction program that REPLACES the provisional `OS − SS`**
currently used in crossx and R_AA (`raa_from_rdf_crossx.md` task_06). The minv
template fit here extracts the signal *fraction/yield* per bin; that yield is then
**acceptance-corrected** and fed into the existing crossx/R_AA normalization. The
program has three physics stages that must be ordered correctly: (1) Δp/p
fake-muon removal; (2) origin-blind detector corrections (efficiency + unfolding)
applied to the *whole mixture* BEFORE the fit; (3) the minv template fit, then
(4) signal acceptance applied to the signal yield AFTER the fit. See Physics
Procedure §3e–§3g and §4.

## Physics Procedure (AUTHORITATIVE)

### 1. Motivation
The single-b signal (both muons from one b-hadron: direct b→μ + cascade b→c→μ) is
opposite-sign, collinear, and low-mass. Under it sit two backgrounds: (a)
uncorrelated **combinatoric** pairs (charge-symmetric), and (b) **gluon-splitting /
open-HF** pairs (g→bb̄, g→cc̄: two muons from two different HF hadrons), also
opposite-sign and low-mass. Same-sign subtraction removes (a) but NOT (b), so the
residual correlated HF background must be removed with an MC-shape template fit.

### 2. Top-level model (per minv bin, fixed single-b kinematic region, 0–4 GeV)
```
OS(m) = S(m) + C(m) + G(m)
SS(m) = C(m) + k · G(m)
```
- `S(m)` — single-b signal (truth flavor category `_single_b` / `from_same_b`).
- `C(m)` — uncorrelated combinatoric, **charge-symmetric**: identical in OS and SS.
  In the fit, `C(m) = N_C · T_mix(m)` where `T_mix` is the unit-normalized
  **mixed-event** shape and **N_C is a free normalization parameter** (the
  mixed-event template has an arbitrary generation normalization, so it MUST be
  scaled — answering the user's "factor on the mixed-event template": yes, that
  factor IS N_C, and it lives inside C). Nominal: the SAME `N_C·T_mix` in OS and SS
  (charge symmetry); if the 5b closure shows a charge asymmetry, free a separate SS
  combinatoric scale `N_C^SS = (1+ε)·N_C` as a systematic.
- `G(m)` — opposite-sign gluon-splitting / open-HF background (truth `_bb`+`_cc`
  +`_one_b_one_c`; origin distinguishes flavor-creation `_FC` from gluon-splitting `_gs_*`/`_GS_*`).
- `k` (0<k<1) — fraction of OS gluon splitting that appears as SS. Only **g→bb̄**
  contributes via either **B⁰–B̄⁰ oscillation** (one neutral-B mixes, flipping a
  muon sign) or **direct+cascade pairing** (one b→μ direct, the partner b̄→c̄→μ →
  same sign); g→cc̄ has no charge-flip mechanism. (NB: cascade+cascade is OS, not
  SS.) So `k` ≈ (osc + direct·cascade prob)·(bb̄ fraction of G).
  **Why k is worth using (robustness):** k is a *ratio* of SS to OS gluon-splitting
  drawn from the *same* g→QQ̄ population, so the absolute (poorly-known, large-
  theory-uncertainty — KB `gluon_splitting_flavour_excitation`) g→QQ̄ cross-section
  largely cancels. k is driven by *measured* quantities (semileptonic BRs, χ_d) plus
  one theory-sensitive piece — the **cc̄:bb̄ ratio in OS** (cc̄ enters OS but not SS).
  This is why anchoring the physics-background normalization via k + SS (data) beats
  taking the G normalization from Pythia directly. Mitigate the cc̄:bb̄ sensitivity:
  cc̄ and bb̄ have different minv shapes (the OS fit partly constrains the mix), and
  bound the rest as a systematic. **k may depend on (pair pT, η, minv)** — measure
  the dependence in MC, do not assume constant.

  **k is EMPIRICAL — what it absorbs vs what can break the model (refined 2026-06-22).**
  k is *measured* as the total correlated-background ratio G_SS/G_OS in MC, so it
  **automatically includes** (i) **flavour excitation (FE)** — ISR g→QQ̄ has the SAME
  QQ̄ charge structure as FSR gluon-splitting (two HF hadrons → identical
  direct/cascade/mixing combinatorics), so FE lives inside G and inside the measured
  k; and (ii) **ALL bb̄ charge-flip mechanisms** — direct+cascade, single AND double
  B⁰ mixing, b-baryons. None of these are "neglected" or separately modeled; they are
  in k by construction. Therefore `SS = C + k·G_OS` can fail ONLY from:
  - (a) **SS sources outside {correlated-HF, combinatoric}** — residual jet/fake muons
    (π/K, punch-through surviving the Δp/p fit) and **>2 HF muons in a jet** (extra
    splittings → wrong-charge pairings not following the simple k). The >2-HF-μ term is
    expected **rare**; if the data closure (5b) shows the OS/SS factor roughly holds, it
    need not be modeled — **carry it as a systematic** (per user 2026-06-22). Residual
    fakes are the part the Δp/p fit must control upstream.
  - (b) **MC mismodeling of the ratio** (cc̄:bb̄ fraction, FE:GS fraction, mixing) — k_data ≠ k_MC. This is the systematic, bounded by the data closure test (Step 5).
  - (c) **combinatoric charge asymmetry** (C_OS ≠ C_SS) — must be checked.
  - (d) **k kinematic dependence** not captured if a single k is used.
  These four — not cascade/mixing/FE — are what Step 5 validation must rule out.

Subtraction identity (consequence): `OS(m) − SS(m) = S(m) + (1−k)·G(m)` — combinatoric
cancels exactly; a fraction (1−k) of gluon splitting survives and is removed by the template.

### 3. Step-by-step method

**The two fits live at two DIFFERENT kinematic levels (resolved 2026-06-22, per user):**
- **Δp/p fake-muon fit → RECO level.** Δp/p = (p_ID − p_MS)/p_ID is the ID-vs-MS
  momentum imbalance — an **intrinsically reconstructed** quantity (no truth analogue),
  so the fake/real separation is done at reco level, BEFORE unfolding.
- **Combinatoric + physics (minv) fit → TRUTH level.** The Pythia templates (signal,
  G, resonances) are **truth-level** objects, so the minv template fit is performed on
  the **unfolded** data (after efficiency + unfolding bring the data to truth level).
  This settles the earlier "fit at reco vs truth" question: minv fit at truth.

a. **Data spectra (this cycle):** fill OS and SS `minv` over **0–4 GeV** in the
   single-b kinematic region **without the mass window** — selection
   `pair_pt>8 && m1.charge*m1.eta<2.2 && m2.charge*m2.eta<2.2`
   (= `signal_cuts` MINUS `minv>1.08 && minv<2.9`; **the ΔR>0.05 cut is REMOVED** —
   per user 2026-06-22, see Design Decisions). Weight = the existing
   crossx differential-cross-section weight, reco+trig corrected:
   - pp: `crossx_weight_trig_corr` (= weight·(1/L_pp)·w_reco·w_trig).
   - PbPb: `weight_for_dsigma_trig_corr` (= weight·(1/L_year)·w_reco·w_trig), per
     centrality, lumi-combined at plot time (ΣN/ΣL). Binning **50 bins, 0–4 GeV**
     to match the Pythia truth `minv_zoomin` template exactly.
   - **⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-06-22):** Steps 2/3 filled these histos in the NOMINAL crossx
     RDF, whose OS tree is **V1 resonance-vetoed** (holes at [0,1.06],[2.9,3.3],…) — wrong
     for the fit, which needs the resonances PRESENT (φ/J/ψ leakage templates, §3h). They
     MUST be re-filled from the **`_no_res_cut`** ntuples in a SEPARATE template-fit pass
     (see Design Decisions: "Template-fit input = `_no_res_cut`"). The `_no_res_cut`
     May-skim production is running (2026-06-22, Condor clusters 42–45).
b. **Templates:** Pythia evgen truth `minv_zoomin` (0–4 GeV) per flavor category
   (`_single_b` = S; `_bb`,`_cc`,`_one_b_one_c` = G; `_resonance(_contaminated)` =
   J/ψ etc.) and per origin category. Truth = no reco, so compared to
   efficiency-corrected data (data unfolded back to truth within acceptance).
c. **Baby-step fit (later cycle):** assume k≈0 → form `D_OS−D_SS` (removes
   combinatoric), fit `= N_S·T_S + N_G·T_G` (TFractionFitter or binned χ²) over
   0–4 GeV, vetoing the J/ψ window [2.95,3.25]. Extract N_S.
d. **Refinement (later):** restore k; coupled OS+SS fit with shared C,G and a
   combinatoric template (event-mixing); float/constrain k.
e. **Correction ordering (origin-blind BEFORE the fit).** The reco+trigger
   efficiencies and the detector response (bin migration / unfolding) are
   properties of the ATLAS muon detector/trigger/offline reconstruction; given the
   pair kinematics they are **independent of pair origin** (the detector cannot
   know signal vs background). They are applied to the **whole mixture before the
   fit**. The PRECISE internal order matters because each correction lives in a
   different kinematic frame (refined 2026-06-22, per user):
   1. **Trigger efficiency** — evaluated as a function of **RECONSTRUCTED**
      kinematics (the trigger fires on reco objects). Apply as a per-pair weight at
      reco level, fill the reco spectrum.
   2. **Unfolding** (reco→truth, bin migration) — a **spectrum-level** operation
      (response matrix / iterative Bayes), NOT a per-pair multiplicative weight.
      Applied to the trigger-corrected reco spectrum.
   3. **Reconstruction efficiency** — evaluated as a function of **TRUTH**
      kinematics (the proper 3D pair ε_reco(truth pair pT, η, ΔR) is defined per
      truth pair), so it is applied **after** unfolding, on the truth spectrum.
   Then the template fit runs at truth level (sharpest signal mass peak; templates
   need no detector folding). **Run 2 precedent (HF-muon R_AA, arXiv:2109.00411 /
   ANA-HION-2019-58 §4.1–4.2):** the ρ and d0 template fits are run on
   **efficiency-weighted** distributions — efficiency FIRST, then fit → N_corr
   directly. (The dimuon note is no counter-precedent: its Δp/p was a purity
   demonstration with no yield subtraction.) **Current-code status (RDF, verified
   2026-06-22):** trigger weight ✓ at reco; reco-eff applied at **reco** kinematics
   (placeholder ε₁·ε₂, NOT truth); unfolding ABSENT (`w_unfold ≡ 1.0` identity).
   The order is therefore not yet implemented — but it is **degenerate now** (both
   weights are reco-level placeholders multiplied together, no unfolding). The
   prescribed trig(reco)→unfold→reco(truth) order is a **structural change** to make
   when (i) real unfolding and (ii) the truth-binned 3D pair ε_reco land (roadmap
   Q4 / task_05). These corrections are NOT applied after the fit.
f. **Signal acceptance (origin-specific, AFTER the fit).** A_sig(pair pT, pair η)
   = P(a truth single-b dimuon passes the signal selection), from signal MC truth
   (Pythia/Powheg). It is signal-only, so it is applied to the **extracted signal
   yield only**, after the fit: `N_sig(X) = N_S^fit(X) / A_sig(X)`. Build it on a
   **fine 2D (pair pT, pair η) grid** (or per-event MC weight) — MC stats are not
   the bottleneck — and project to the 1D observable. Default: **fiducial**
   measurement (A_sig corrects only cuts not in the binning — the mass window, ΔR,
   single-μ thresholds — and resolution at the pair-pT>8 boundary), no full
   phase-space extrapolation unless decided otherwise.
   - **Binning (refined 2026-06-22, per user):** use **log pair-pT binning** — even
     with Pythia pT-hat slices the pair-pT count spectrum falls as a power law, so
     log bins give roughly uniform stats per bin. Pair-η **coarse** (pair-η
     resolution for this study is low). Before trusting the map, **plot
     A_sig(pair pT) projected in a few pair-η bins** to confirm per-bin statistics
     and smoothness. Expect to **fit/interpolate the pair-pT dependence** with a
     smooth function and **Eval at the exact pair pT** rather than using raw bin
     values (continuous-function convention — see memory `feedback_use_continuous_fit_function`),
     so statistical bin-to-bin fluctuations do not propagate into the correction.
   - **What A_sig covers vs what reco-eff covers (clarified 2026-06-22, per user
     Q11):** the single-muon **kinematic/fiducial** cuts — **pT>4, |η|<2.4** — are
     ACCEPTANCE (truth-level: did the truth muons land in the fiducial region). The
     **reco-eff** is conditional on that: P(reconstruct+ID a muon ALREADY in the
     fiducial region), and it also carries the **resolution smearing across the pT>4 /
     η edges** (in/out migration). The **Δp/p / quality / ID** cuts are reco-level
     selections → they belong to **reco-eff / fake-removal, NOT acceptance** (no truth
     analogue). **CRITICAL caveat — verify the pair reco-eff denominator** (fullsim):
     if its denominator is "truth pairs already inside the single-μ fiducial
     (pT>4,|η|<2.4)", then A_sig and ε_reco factorize cleanly and A_sig owns the pT>4/
     |η|<2.4 cuts; if the denominator is "ALL truth single-b pairs", then ε_reco
     ALREADY contains the single-μ kinematic acceptance → A_sig must NOT re-apply it
     (double-count). Settle this before building A_sig.
g. **Feed crossx & R_AA (replace OS−SS).** The acceptance-corrected N_sig(X)
   replaces the `OS − SS` count that `raa_from_rdf_crossx.md` §3 currently feeds
   into the normalization (pp: 1/L; PbPb: crossx_factor carrying 1/N_evt·1/⟨T_AA⟩).
   No OS−SS anywhere in the final chain.
h. **Resonance leakage into the signal window (OS-only — added 2026-06-22, per
   user).** The OS muon-pair trees are resonance-VETOED at **reco** minv in windows
   [0,1.06], [2.9,3.3] (J/ψ), [3.55,3.8] (ψ′) (see Results & Observations; veto is
   OS-only — SS has no resonances). Reco smearing widens the narrow truth peaks, so
   a φ (1.019) or J/ψ (3.097) can be reconstructed *outside* its veto window and
   **leak into the signal mass window** — an OS-only contamination.
   - **Unfolding does NOT remove it.** The response matrix is built from *signal*
     MC, which contains no resonances; unfolding migrates a leaked-resonance reco
     count as if it were signal → contaminates the truth signal spectrum. Leakage
     must be handled in the fit, not by unfolding.
   - **Effect on the combined OS+SS fit:** the leaked resonance tail is OS-only,
     exactly like signal (SS has none) → without modeling it, the fit attributes it
     to signal and **biases N_S up**.
   - **Treatment (DECIDED 2026-06-22, per user): build OS-only resonance mass
     templates that ACCOUNT FOR THE SMEARING and include them in the minv template
     fit.** Even though the fit is performed after unfolding, the leaked-resonance
     contamination is a reco-smearing effect that the signal-only unfolding does not
     remove, so a dedicated resonance component is added to the OS fit model:
     `OS(m) = S + C + G_OS + Σ_r R_r(m)`, with `R_r` the φ/J/ψ/ψ′ templates (SS has
     none). Build `R_r` from a **no-veto OS pass** (`trigger_effcy_calc=true` skips
     the resonance cut — R&O): take the **reconstructed (smeared)** resonance peak
     shape and carry it through the SAME signal unfolding as the data, so `R_r`
     represents the residual the resonance leaves in the fit space. Each `R_r`
     normalization can be constrained from the peak region outside the signal window.
   - **Signal-window upper edge = 2.9 (CONFIRMED 2026-06-22):** the window is
     **1.08–2.9** (the earlier "2.6" was a user typo). With the J/ψ veto starting at
     2.9 there is no buffer, so the smeared-J/ψ template above is REQUIRED, not
     optional — its tail leaks directly below 2.9 into the signal window.

**Granularity (applies to the whole program):** the template fits (§3c/§3d and the
Δp/p fake fit) are **data-statistics-limited → coarse, 1D in the plotted
observable** (per pT bin for R_AA vs pT; per η bin in coarse pT slices for R_AA vs
η) — NOT a fine 2D (pT,η) fit grid. The MC corrections (efficiency, acceptance)
are **fine** (MC-limited, not data-limited). Do not couple their granularities.

**Δp/p fake-muon removal (precedes everything).** Fakes (π/K decay-in-flight,
mis-ID) are removed first via the Δp/p significance template fit (task_07 / roadmap
step 16), because the muon efficiency is defined for real muons. The Run 2 dimuon
note found >98% purity ⇒ likely a flat/coarse purity factor or demonstration-only.

### 4. Negative constraints
- The signal selection is `pair_pt>8 && per-muon q·η<2.2` ONLY (mass window applied
  separately; **NO ΔR cut** — ΔR>0.05 removed 2026-06-22). The minv histograms drop
  the minv-window part; OS and SS use this identical selection.
- **Do NOT apply any ΔR cut in signal selections** (data spectra, truth templates,
  acceptance, mixed-event). ΔR is still a reco-eff binning axis, NOT a selection cut.
- OS and SS MUST use the SAME selection, binning, and efficiency+lumi weight, so
  OS−SS is a subtraction of identically-normalized spectra.
- MUST NOT reuse the T_AA-weighted `weight_for_RAA_trig_corr` for the spectra — the
  cross-section normalization is the 1/L `dsigma` weight (pp `crossx_weight_trig_corr`).
- Template (truth) selection MUST match the data kinematic region
  (truth pair_pt>8, per-muon truth q·η<2.2; **NO ΔR cut**); the ORIGINAL truth
  per-category minv fills are INCLUSIVE (no kinematic cut) — see Results & Observations.
- k is bb̄-only; do not model g→cc̄ as contributing to SS beyond the lumped approximation.
- **Do NOT apply efficiency/unfolding after the fit** — they are origin-blind, so
  they go first, on the whole mixture (§3e). **Do NOT apply signal acceptance to the
  mixture** — it is signal-only, applied to the fitted signal yield AFTER the fit
  (§3f); applying it to a contaminated yield corrects background with a signal factor.
- **Do NOT leave OS−SS as the final background subtraction** in crossx/R_AA. OS−SS
  cancels combinatoric but leaves `(1−k)·G` (correlated physics bkg); it is retained
  only as the provisional first-look (task_06) until this program replaces it (§3g).
- **Combinatoric C comes from the mixed-event method**, not from SS. SS's role is the
  G-normalization anchor via k (§2), not the combinatoric estimate.
- **Do NOT take the G (gluon-splitting/open-HF) normalization from Pythia as nominal**
  once k is validated — use the SS-anchored normalization; keep pure-MC normalization
  as a systematic cross-check.
- k and the combinatoric charge symmetry (C_OS ≈ C_SS) MUST be validated in MC before
  the coupled OS+SS fit is trusted; if k fails, fall back to pure-MC templates and
  carry the full g→QQ̄ theory uncertainty.

## Context
- pp crossx fill: `RDFBasedHistFillingPP.cxx` — `signal_cuts` (L382), OS weighted
  node `df_single_b_crossx_weighted` (L421+, `crossx_weight_trig_corr` L433), SS block
  (L476–513). 1D minv currently only as 2D `h2d_crossx_pair_pt_minv_w_signal_cuts` (L515).
- PbPb crossx fill: `RDFBasedHistFillingPbPb.cxx` — `signal_cuts` (L920), OS weighted
  node `df_single_b_crossx_weighted` (L962+, `weight_for_dsigma_trig_corr` L983), SS
  block (L1011–1044), per-centrality loop (L1048+), dσ minv as 2D (L1083).
- Pythia truth templates: `RDFBasedHistFillingPythiaTruth.cxx` — `FillHistogramsFlavorBinned`
  (L254), `FillHistogramsOriginBinned` (L281); truth `minv_zoomin` 0–4 GeV (50 bins,
  `var1D_pythia_truth.json`) filled as 2D `{pair_pt, minv_zoomin}` per category, OS
  (`_sign2`/df_op_weighted) and SS (`_sign1`/df_ss_weighted). Category maps:
  `MuonObjectsParamsAndHelpers/muon_pair_enums_MC_utils.h` (flavor `_single_b/_bb/_cc/...`,
  origin `_FC/_gs_FSR/_GS_ISR_*/...`).

## Scope
In (this cycle): OS+SS 0–4 GeV no-mass-cut minv data histos (pp + PbPb per centrality),
eff+lumi (dσ) weighted. Out (later cycles): truth templates with matching kinematic
selection; the fitter; combinatoric (event-mixing) template; k determination; plots.

## Design Decisions
- **Binning 50×[0,4] GeV** to match Pythia truth `minv_zoomin` for apples-to-apples fit.
- **Self-contained new branches** off `df_op`/`df_ss` filtered with `signal_cuts_no_minv`,
  replicating the existing trig+reco+dσ weight chain (mirrors the existing self-contained
  SS block), rather than restructuring the shared weighted node — lower risk, no change
  to existing histograms. Reviewer may suggest factoring the weight chain into a helper.
- **Names:** `h1d_crossx_minv_0_4_{op,ss}_dsigma` (pp); `..._{op,ss}_dsigma_<ctr>` (PbPb).
  "0_4" = full 0–4 GeV spectrum (no mass window); "dsigma" = 1/L cross-section weight.
- **ΔR>0.05 REMOVED from the signal selection (2026-06-22, user).** Old: signal
  required ΔR(μ,μ)>0.05. New: no ΔR cut anywhere in the signal selection (data, truth
  templates, acceptance, mixed-event). Reason (user decision): keep the full collinear
  single-b regime. ΔR remains a **reco-eff binning axis**, not a selection. Consequence:
  data histos (Steps 2/3) and truth templates (4a), both filled with ΔR>0.05, must be
  regenerated; `analysis_overview` §2 and the RDF `signal_cuts` must drop ΔR too.
  Implication to watch: very-low-ΔR pairs (near-merged muons) now enter — the reco-eff
  ΔR binning must cover ΔR→0 reliably.
- **Reco-eff / acceptance boundary VERIFIED — no double-count, no reco-eff change
  (2026-06-22, investigation).** pT>4/|η|<2.4 is NOT folded into either reco-eff value:
  (a) fullsim 3D pair ε_reco — the truth fiducial (`PythiaAlgCoreT::PassCuts_PythiaCore`,
  truth pT>4 & |truth η|<2.4) is in BOTH numerator and denominator → cancels → ε_reco is
  conditional; (b) placeholder `EvaluateSingleMuonRecoEffPlaceholder` clamps pT to [4,19]
  as a range floor (not a cut), η only for barrel/endcap. ⇒ **acceptance owns
  pT>4/|η|<2.4; do NOT change reco-eff.** CRITICAL for the acceptance build (Step 7): the
  A_sig DENOMINATOR must come from the `h_cutAcceptance` cutflow (all truth pairs in the
  `nocut` bin, filled BEFORE `PassCuts`), NOT the pair tree (already fiducial-restricted
  → A≈1). Edge migration across pT=4/|η|=2.4 is owned by **unfolding** (detec_resp), not
  reco-eff or acceptance.
- **Template-fit input = `_no_res_cut`, in a SEPARATE pass — NOT the nominal V1 crossx
  (DECIDED 2026-06-22 from the pipeline investigation).** Background: the investigation
  enumerated the nominal crossx histograms and found it DOES produce generic non-signal-cut
  histos that span the resonance region (case (b)): the 0–4 GeV `h1d_crossx_minv_0_4_{op,ss}`
  template inputs, plus (pp only) `minv_zoomin`/`minv_log`. So:
  - **Keep nominal/crossx on V1** (`_mindR_0_02`, `resonance_cut_mode=1`) for the signal-region
    crossx/R_AA program AND the diagnostic generic plots that expect clean V1 resonance removal.
    (Confirmed: the 06-08 PbPb nominal ran in NOMINAL mode — photoproduction cut APPLIED, V1
    OS veto — and the crossx reads the intact hadded V1 `_mindR_0_02.root`.)
  - **The low-mass template fit needs the resonances PRESENT** (to build the φ/J/ψ leakage
    templates, §3h) ⇒ it MUST read **`_no_res_cut`** (`resonance_cut_mode=0`), which CANNOT be
    folded into nominal (that would leave resonances in the nominal OS generic histos and break
    the OS−SS combinatoric logic that assumes the V1-vetoed OS tree). ⇒ build the template fit
    as a **SEPARATE pipeline mode/pass** that reads the `_no_res_cut` ntuples.
  - **Consequence:** the Step 2/3 `h1d_crossx_minv_0_4_{op,ss}_dsigma[_<ctr>]` histos (filled in
    the nominal V1 crossx, so their OS has V1 resonance HOLES) are **superseded** — they must be
    re-filled from `_no_res_cut` in the separate template-fit pass. (§3a updated.)
  - **Logic flow (answering the user):** separate no-res template-fit pass → per coarse RAA bin,
    fit {signal, GS, FE, mixed-event comb, φ/J/ψ resonance templates} on the 0–4 GeV OS+SS →
    signal fraction/yield per bin → acceptance-correct → feed crossx/R_AA (§3f/§3g). The nominal
    V1 crossx still provides the signal-region normalization; the no-res fit provides the
    background-subtracted signal yield that replaces OS−SS.
- **ScrambGen revival approach (2026-06-22, plan):** rewrite ScrambGen to the modern
  object model (read `MuonObj`, WRITE `muon_pair_tree_sign1/sign2` with `MuonPairObj`) so
  the **existing RDF `signal_cuts` fills the mixed-event minv template** — identical
  selection to the data D_OS/D_SS. ScrambGen becomes a pure pair generator: DROP its
  resonance/photoproduction vetoes + dR bucketing (cuts move to RDF). Defaults adopted:
  **20 centrality intervals** (0–100%, `ParamsSet::nCtrIntvls`), **per-year** PbPb mixing
  (combine downstream), **×5 oversampling** for `nScramb` (template is shape-only; N_C
  floats). Same-centrality (≤5%) mixing kept. Requires a single-muon-tree production pass
  first (stale/missing for the May 2026 skim). ScrambGen currently does NOT compile (uses
  the retired `class Muon`); the rewrite fixes that and ensures consistency.
- **`_res_cut_v2` NOMINAL fallback REMOVED (2026-06-23, user directive 1).** Background:
  the data RDF `SetIOPathsHook` nominal/crossx branch had a multi-candidate fallback list
  (`_mindR_0_02.root` → `_res_cut_v2.root` → `_no_res_cut.root` → bare `.root`) built when
  the analysis was still on the OLD skim that lacked `mindR` branches, so it could limp
  along on a V2/no-res file if V1 was missing. The May-2026 skim HAS the mindR branches and
  V1 `_mindR_0_02.root` is always produced for nominal ⇒ the fallback is **obsolete and
  unsafe** (it could silently feed the wrong resonance-cut variant into crossx/R_AA). New
  behavior: the **nominal/crossx** branch (`!trigger_effcy_calc` for PP;
  `mu4_nominal_pbpb_NO_trig_calc` for PbPb) requires ONLY V1 `_mindR_0_02.root` and **throws
  a descriptive error if absent** — no silent fallback. The **trigger-efficiency** branch
  (`_res_cut_v2` first) is UNCHANGED (V2 is the correct trig-eff input — see
  `data_analysis.md` resonance-cut convention, memory `project_resonance_cut_modes`).
- **Gate-driven autonomy (2026-06-23, user directive 2).** The template-fit mode is built
  end-to-end to produce per-R_AA-bin signal yields wired straight into the R_AA inputs, BUT
  the **k-validation + a closure plot** (Step 5) are delivered as intermediate results and
  reviewed with `/review-plot` using physics. The GATE is the **major combined-fit
  assumption**: the SS correlated-physics background (GS + FE) equals the OS correlated-physics
  background times a factor, i.e. `G_SS = k·G_OS` (and the full `SS = C + k·G_OS`). **If
  validated → proceed autonomously and wire into R_AA without waiting for review.** **If it
  fails → STOP/BLOCK and wait for the user's decision** (the fallback the user named: switch
  to **MC-only templates with SEPARATE fits for SS and OS**, abandoning the coupled OS+SS fit).
- **Template-fit mode is part of the nominal/crossx pipeline (2026-06-23, user directive 2).**
  Even though it reads a DIFFERENT input file (`_no_res_cut`), the template fit is integrated
  into the nominal/crossx pipeline dependency chain: **any change to the template fit MUST
  rerun crossx & R_AA** (because the fitted signal yield replaces OS−SS in the R_AA inputs).
  The pipeline wiring must encode this so a template-fit change cannot leave stale crossx/R_AA.
- **Gate criterion CONFIRMED = k(m,pT,η) function, NOT constant scalar (2026-06-23, user).** The
  coupled OS+SS fit uses the SS and OS correlated backgrounds' OWN MC shapes (sign1/sign2 templates)
  tied by a per-bin normalization, so a mass-dependent k is EXPECTED — NOT a failure. The gate is
  therefore: (a) is the MC-predicted ratio ROBUST against the cc̄:bb̄ theory uncertainty, and (b)
  does it survive the **5b data closure**. **Focus now on k(m,pT,η): if it passes the closure test,
  proceed to Part 2c.** The first-look constant-scalar FAIL (k(m) 0.14→0.38) is retained only as the
  justification artifact (see "Save validation results" below), not as a gate verdict.
- **TWO candidate code sets for the FINAL background subtraction — consider, do NOT implement B yet
  (2026-06-23, user).** Because `G_SS(m)` does NOT share `G_OS(m)`'s shape:
  - **(A) SS+OP COMBINED fit** with k(m,pT,η) from MC — the current path (build this).
  - **(B) MC-ONLY fit** (NO SS+OP combined) — separate SS/OS fits with pure-MC templates. **NOT
    implemented yet; a possibility to keep in mind.** The deeper open question it addresses: *if the
    SS shape does not trace the OS shape, is SS a valid reference for OS at all, and does the combined
    fit actually buy us anything against the large g→QQ̄ theory uncertainty?* Revisit (A)-vs-(B) after
    the 5b closure result; if closure is marginal or the cc̄:bb̄ sensitivity is large, (B) becomes the
    serious alternative. Keep the two as SEPARATE code sets so either can be the nominal.
- **Save validation results to a dedicated, non-overwriting folder (2026-06-23, user).** All k-validation
  (5a/5b) deliverables — plots (NOT overwritten), backed-up analysis code, numerical values, and a
  written summary doc — live together under `dimuon_data/plots/template_fitting/` (dated subfolders per
  snapshot). This preserves the evidence justifying the constant-scalar-fails finding and the k(m,pT,η)
  characterization.
- **ScrambGen rewrite — input/output formats + 5 open-question resolutions (2026-06-23, from the read-only
  scoping subagent `_sub_scrambgen_rewrite_scope_1.md`, merged + verified).** INPUT: single-muon trees =
  one TTree `muon_tree`, one branch `MuonObj` (type `MuonPbPb` PbPb / `MuonPP` pp), **one entry = one muon**
  carrying its own `ev_num`, `pt/eta/phi/charge`, `ev_centrality` (percent 0–84, −1 if >85%/invalid),
  `ev_FCal_Et`. The per-ctr `muon_tree_ctr{N}` trees were NOT written → the rewrite **bins muons itself** by
  `ev_centrality`. The `_hadd.root` files are empty (hadd needs the dict) → read parts via `TChain("muon_tree")`.
  OUTPUT: the RDF reads `muon_pair_tree_sign1`(SS)/`muon_pair_tree_sign2`(OS), branch `MuonPairObj`
  (`MuonPairPbPb`/`MuonPairPP`). Construct a pair: `p.m1=muonA; p.m2=muonB; p.year=yr; p.weight=1.0; p.Update();`
  — `Update()` computes minv (m_μ=0.105658), pair_pt/eta, dr, same_sign, avg_centrality. Sign: same_sign→sign1,
  else sign2. ScrambGen must include `DataAnalysisClasses.h` (object-branch dict). **RESOLUTIONS:**
  (1) **nScramb** = `5 × N_muons(interval)` per 5% interval (shape-only, N_C floats — no stale tables);
  (2) **ev_centrality<0 muons EXCLUDED** (outside 0–80%); (3) **spill DROPPED** — strict same 5% interval
  (`nCtrIntvls=20`, `CtrStep=5`, idx=ev_centrality/5); (4) **avg_centrality set EXPLICITLY** post-`Update()`
  to `(m1.ev_centrality+m2.ev_centrality)/2` (year-independent; bypasses the ambiguous yr25 single-event FCal
  recalc; both muons same interval so the average is well-defined); (5) **RDF mixed-event IO hook** (read the
  scrambled file → fill `T_mix`) is a SEPARATE step after ScrambGen. Mixing core: pick i; pick j≠i with
  `ev_num[j]≠ev_num[i]` (no same-event pairs); NO resonance/photoprod/dR cuts (now in the RDF signal_cuts).
  Output `muon_pairs_pbpb_20YY_single_mu4_scrambled.root` / `muon_pairs_pp_2024_2mu4_scrambled.root`. Per-year
  (combine downstream); run locally (in-memory, fast). PP: single bin, `MuonPP`/`MuonPairPP`, no year/avg_centrality.
- **Subagent scratch-doc procedure (2026-06-23, CLAUDE.md update, user directive 3).** For
  any delegated semi-complex investigation/implementation, each subagent checkpoints to its
  OWN scratch doc (`Analysis/docs/tracking/_sub_<task>_<n>.md`), append-only, never the
  canonical doc; subagents NEVER run git or edit shared files. The orchestrator (this agent)
  merges each scratch doc into this canonical doc's Progress Log on return, THEN deletes the
  scratch file. Reviewer subagents (`/review-*`) are stateless and exempt.

## Implementation Plan
1. Tracking doc + Physics Procedure (this file). DONE.
2. Add OS+SS 0–4 GeV no-mass-cut minv histos to PP + PbPb crossx RDF (per §3a,§4).
   → `/review-analysis-code` (quote §2,§3a,§4). ACLiC compile. **DONE** (2026-06-21,
   reviewer PASS iter 1).
3. Recompile + rerun crossx RDF (pp + 3 PbPb, skip ntuple); sanity-check the new
   histos (non-empty, OS≥SS in continuum). **DONE** (2026-06-21, all 4 years).
4a. Truth templates: 1D `minv_zoomin` (0–4 GeV) per flavor + origin category, OS+SS,
   with the MATCHING truth single-b kinematic selection (`truth_pair_pt>8 &&
   m1.truth_charge*m1.truth_eta<2.2 && m2.truth_charge*m2.truth_eta<2.2`,
   **NO ΔR cut**, no minv cut). New method in `RDFBasedHistFillingPythiaTruth`
   mirroring `FillHistogramsFlavorBinned/OriginBinned`, suffix `_sigsel`. (per §3b,§4)
   → `/review-analysis-code` (quote §3b,§4). **DONE & REGENERATED WITHOUT ΔR (2026-06-22).**
   Method `FillHistogramsTemplateMinvSignalRegion` added; the ΔR-cut-removal sweep
   (`remove_dr_cut_signal_selection.md`, `/review-analysis-code`+`/review-plot` PASS)
   dropped `truth_dr>0.05` from its `kin_cuts` and refilled pythia truth (output
   `pythia_5p36TeV/histograms_pythia_5p36TeV_no_data_resonance_cuts.root`, 01:28; backup
   `hist_backup_20260622_pre_dr_cut_removal/`). Verified: 32 `_sigsel` histos
   (2 signs × {9 flavor + 7 origin}); OS `single_b` integral 12.54 / 2.23M ent, OS `bb`
   1.32 / 1.40M ent, 50 bins 0–4 GeV. Step 2/3 data histos likewise refilled without ΔR
   by the same sweep → templates and data spectra are selection-consistent.
4b. (later) Fitter; plots.
5. (later) **k-ratio validation study — the GATE for the combined fit** (per §2
   "k is EMPIRICAL"). TWO levels, both REQUIRED; save all plots as the
   justification (or, if it fails, the explanation to colleagues for falling back
   to pure-MC templates):
   - **(5a) MC truth-level k.** Using Pythia truth ORIGIN/FLAVOR labels, compute
     k(bin) = G_SS(bin)/G_OS(bin) from the truth-G categories (`_bb`,`_cc`,
     `_one_b_one_c`; FSR gs + ISR FE together) over the fit minv window, **as a
     function of pair pT and pair η** (and minv). Deliverable: k maps + projections
     → is k stable, or does it need (pT,η) dependence? Decompose k into the robust
     part (BRs, χ_d) vs the theory-sensitive cc̄:bb̄ part for the systematic.
     **Sufficiency note (answering the user):** the origin-categorized 0–4 GeV minv
     distributions ARE sufficient to measure k itself — but NOT to validate the full
     `SS=C+kG` model, because they cannot see the jet/fake/>2-HF terms (§2 a) or the
     real combinatoric. So 5a is necessary but not sufficient; 5b is required.
   - **(5b) Data-level closure.** Predict SS_data ?= C_mixed-event + k·G_OS,MC and
     overlay vs the ACTUAL SS data, **per (pair pT, pair η) bin**. Agreement across
     all bins ⇒ the assumption holds (no significant jet/fake/>2-HF SS excess, k_MC
     ≈ k_data). Disagreement localizes the failure. This is the test of the user's
     real concern (the non-HF SS terms).
   - Also verify **C_OS ≈ C_SS** (combinatoric charge symmetry) from the mixed-event
     template.
   → `/review-investigation` then `/review-plot` (quote §2, §3c/§3d, §4).
   **Raw material:** 5a needs the truth origin/flavor minv ALSO binned in (pair pT,
   pair η) — Step 4a produced 1D minv per category with the matching selection but
   may be pT/η-integrated; CHECK and, if so, add a (pT,η)-binned truth fill first.
   5b needs the mixed-event template (Step 6) → so Step 6 partly precedes 5b.
5'. (later) **Resonance-leakage quantification (§3h).** No-veto OS pass
   (`trigger_effcy_calc=true`); fit φ/J/ψ/ψ′ peaks; extrapolate tails into the
   signal window; report tail/signal ratio. Decide: add OS-only resonance template
   vs negligible-with-systematic. Settle the 2.6-vs-2.9 signal-window edge first.
   → `/review-investigation`, `/review-plot` (quote §3h). **Raw material:** a
   no-resonance-veto ntuple/RDF pass (exists via `trigger_effcy_calc=true`).
6. (later) **Coupled OS+SS fit + event-mixing combinatoric**, per coarse RAA bin →
   N_S^fit(X). **Mixed-event template is NOT ready** (Step 6 prereq, verified
   2026-06-22): `ScrambGen/` exists (PbPb + PP) and does same-centrality (≤5%)
   mixing, but (i) its resonance veto removes exactly our low-mass fit region —
   must switch to our signal selection (pair_pt>8, per-muon q·η<2.2, dR>0.05) with
   NO/looser mass window; (ii) it reads FLAT single-muon branches while the current
   producer writes a `MuonObj` object branch — reconcile before re-running; (iii)
   existing outputs are the 2023 skim (`scrambled_muon_pairs_*.root`, local GPFS) —
   must re-run on the May 2026 skim; (iv) regenerate the hard-coded `nScramb` target
   counts. ⇒ revive+modify+rerun ScrambGen before 5b/6.
   → `/review-analysis-code`, `/review-plot` (quote §3c/§3d, §4).
7. (later) **Signal acceptance** 2D MC map; `N_sig = N_S^fit / A_sig` after the fit.
   → `/review-analysis-code`, `/review-plot` (quote §3f).
8. (later) **Wire into crossx & R_AA**, replacing OS−SS (`raa_from_rdf_crossx.md`).
   → `/review-analysis-code`, `/review-plot` (quote §3g, §4).
9. (later) **Systematics** — k uncertainty, cc̄:bb̄, template shapes, mixed-event
   normalization, fit model, fiducial vs extrapolated. → `/review-analysis-code`.

## Progress Log
- 2026-06-18 — Step 1: doc created. Established OS/SS background model (§2), grounded
  truth categories (`_single_b/_bb/_cc`, origin `_FC/_gs_*`). Confirmed existing dσ
  weights (`crossx_weight_trig_corr` pp, `weight_for_dsigma_trig_corr` PbPb) are the
  correct crossx normalization. Found existing truth per-category minv fills are
  KINEMATICALLY INCLUSIVE (no pair_pt/q·η/dr cut) and stored 2D — see R&O.

- 2026-06-21 — **Steps 2+3 DONE** (`/review-analysis-code` PASS iter 1; log
  `.claude/logs/review-analysis-code-20260621-235115-low-mass-minv-os-ss.md`). Added the
  no-mass-cut OS+SS minv histos to PP (`RDFBasedHistFillingPP.cxx`, end of
  `FillHistogramsCrossx`: `h1d_crossx_minv_0_4_{op,ss}_dsigma`, weight
  `crossx_weight_trig_corr`) and PbPb (`RDFBasedHistFillingPbPb.cxx`, per centrality:
  `h1d_crossx_minv_0_4_{op,ss}_dsigma_<ctr>`, weight `weight_for_dsigma_trig_corr`),
  50 bins 0–4 GeV, selection `signal_cuts` minus the minv window, OS=df_op/SS=df_ss
  identical. ACLiC-clean (separate sessions). Reran crossx pp24 + pbpb23/24/25 (read
  existing ntuples): pp 2 new 1D histos, each PbPb year 12 (6 ctr × OS+SS), all
  non-empty. Sanity: PP OS integral 6209 ≥ SS 990.6 (OS≥SS all continuum bins, 0
  violations); PbPb ctr0_5 SS/OS≈0.72 (large central combinatoric, expected).

- 2026-06-21 — **Scope extended to the full background-subtraction program**
  (planning only, no code). Added: correction-ordering as authoritative procedure
  (origin-blind eff+unfolding BEFORE the fit; signal acceptance AFTER — §3e/§3f);
  R_AA integration replacing OS−SS (§3g); k-ratio robustness via the cc̄:bb̄
  decomposition (§2); granularity split (coarse data fits, fine MC corrections);
  Δp/p fake removal as the first stage; extended negative constraints (§4) and plan
  steps 5–9. Grounded in KB `concepts/muon_source_template_fits`,
  `physics/background/gluon_splitting_flavour_excitation`. A duplicate doc
  (`template_fit_background_subtraction.md`) drafted this session was deleted in
  favor of extending this one (no-duplication rule). **Awaiting explicit user
  approval before any implementation of steps 5–9; steps 2–4 remain as previously
  planned.** Roadmap step 16 updated to point here (OS−SS marked provisional).

- 2026-06-22 — **Physics Procedure refined from 9-point user review (planning only).**
  (1) §3e efficiency ORDER made precise: trigger(reco) → unfold(spectrum-level) →
  reco-eff(truth), then fit at truth; confirmed by Run-2 HF-muon precedent
  (efficiency-weight FIRST, then ρ/d0 fit → N_corr; ANA-HION-2019-58 §4.1–4.2) and
  by a code check (RDF currently: trig ✓ reco-level, reco-eff at RECO not truth,
  unfolding `w_unfold≡1.0` absent → order degenerate now, structural change due when
  real unfolding + 3D truth-binned pair ε_reco land, task_05/Q4). (2) §2 reframed:
  **k is EMPIRICAL** → FE (ISR g→QQ̄, same charge structure as FSR GS) and ALL bb̄
  charge-flip mechanisms (direct+cascade, single+double mixing, b-baryons) are IN k,
  not neglected; the model breaks only from non-HF SS (jet/fake, >2 HF μ), k_MC≠k_data
  mismodeling, C_OS≠C_SS, or uncaptured k(pT,η). (3) New §3h: OS-only **resonance
  leakage** (φ/J/ψ smeared past the reco veto into the signal window) — unfolding
  does NOT remove it (signal-only response matrix), biases N_S up in the combined
  fit; treat via OS-only resonance template or prove negligible; 2.6-vs-2.9 signal
  edge flagged. (4) §3f acceptance: log pair-pT binning + projection check +
  fit/interpolate. (5) Step 5 split into 5a (MC truth k) + 5b (data closure) — origin-
  categorized minv alone validates k but NOT the full SS=C+kG (can't see jet/fake);
  new Step 5' resonance quantification. (6) Step 6: mixed-event ScrambGen NOT ready
  (stale, wrong mass veto, flat-vs-MuonObj input mismatch, 2023 outputs) → revive+
  modify+rerun. KB `gluon_splitting_flavour_excitation` synced (empirical-k framing).
  **No code; awaiting user approval.**

- 2026-06-22 (2) — **Second 9-point user round applied (planning + 1 code comment).**
  (1) RDF `w_unfold` placeholder comment in PP+PbPb now states unfolding is a
  spectrum-level structural change, not a weight (code comment only, no behavior
  change). (2) §3 lead note: Δp/p fake fit at RECO (intrinsic ID−MS), minv physics+comb
  fit at TRUTH (Pythia templates) — settles the fit-level question. (3) >2-HF-μ reframed
  as rare → systematic if k holds (§2a). (4) §3h resonance: DECIDED to build smeared
  OS-only resonance templates and include them in the fit (`OS=S+C+G+ΣR_r`); window
  CONFIRMED 1.08–2.9 (2.6 was a typo). (5) §2 C: clarified `C=N_C·T_mix`, N_C a free
  fit parameter (the mixed-event normalization the user asked about); C_OS=C_SS nominal.
  (9) **ΔR>0.05 REMOVED** from the signal selection everywhere (Design Decisions); data
  histos + truth templates must be regenerated; analysis_overview §2 updated; RDF
  `signal_cuts` flagged (other agent in that code). (11) §3f: pT>4/|η|<2.4 = acceptance,
  Δp/p/quality = reco-eff/fake; clean split requires verifying the pair reco-eff
  denominator. KB `gluon_splitting_flavour_excitation` re-synced (>2-HF-μ→systematic).
  **No physics code/behavior change; awaiting user approval to start steps 5–9.**

- 2026-06-22 (3) — **AUTONOMOUS IMPLEMENTATION APPROVED — orchestration started.** User:
  defer Δp/p (mark future-TODO needing MC); run preliminary with placeholder reco-eff +
  identity unfolding; start with reco-eff & ScrambGen; proceed autonomously as orchestrator,
  parallelize independent tasks, tracking-doc + commit each step. **T0 reco-eff/acceptance
  boundary VERIFIED** (parallel read-only investigation): no double-count — acceptance owns
  pT>4/|η|<2.4, denominator from `h_cutAcceptance` cutflow; no reco-eff change (Design
  Decisions). **T0 Δp/p deferred** in `placeholder.md` #9 + roadmap step 16. **ScrambGen
  plan** captured (Design Decisions; object-model rewrite, cuts in RDF, 20 ctr intervals,
  per-year, ×5 oversampling; needs single-muon-tree production first). Confirmed
  `signal_cuts` is already ΔR-free (RDFBasedHistFillingPP.cxx:382). Next: T1a single-muon-
  tree production (→ Condor) ∥ T1b ScrambGen rewrite (→ /review-analysis-code). Orchestration
  graph in Latest Stage.

- 2026-06-22 (4) — **INCIDENT + RECOVERY: T1a single-muon jobs clobbered PbPb nominal
  muon_pairs.** Root cause: `output_single_muon_tree` is a **protected** member
  (`DimuonDataAlgCoreT.h:32` re-exposes the public base member under protected — a
  regression vs the Oct-2025 era when the existing single-muon scripts worked), so the
  macro assignment `pbpb_2X.output_single_muon_tree = true;` failed to compile in cling;
  `Run()` then executed in DEFAULT mode (output_single_muon_tree=false) AND without
  `pbpb_run3_mu4_force_nominal=true` → `trigger_effcy_calc=TRUE` (no resonance veto) →
  each job opened the NOMINAL `muon_pairs_pbpb_2X_part*_single_mu4_mindR_0_02_res_cut_v2.root`
  with `recreate` and wrote wrong-mode (or truncated, for killed jobs) content. **Scope:**
  PbPb 23/24/25 nominal muon_pairs (+ hists_cut_acceptance) clobbered (Jun 22 02:35–02:40).
  **PP nominal SAFE** (pp single-muon script lacked `trigger_mode=3` → wrote a different
  filename, not the nominal `_2mu4_*`; pp nominal files remain Jun 10). **Response:**
  (1) `condor_rm yuhanguo` to stop the 17 still-running jobs; (2) resubmitted nominal PbPb
  production run_pbpb_2{3,4,5}_nominal.sub (clusters 86/87/88, 12 jobs) to deterministically
  restore from intact raw data (`pbpb_run3_mu4_force_nominal` is PUBLIC so nominal scripts
  work). **Pending fixes before re-running T1a:** make `output_single_muon_tree` publicly
  settable (header), and add `pbpb_run3_mu4_force_nominal=true` (pbpb) / `trigger_mode=3`
  (pp) to the single-muon scripts so muon selection matches nominal. Single-muon jobs are
  SAFE once output_single_muon_tree works (they write `single_muon_trees_*`, not muon_pairs).
  **Lesson:** verify a Condor job's first output is the intended filename before submitting
  a full fleet; the protected-member assignment failed SILENTLY in cling (non-fatal error,
  Run() proceeded).

- 2026-06-22 (5) — **INCIDENT recovery is INCOMPLETE — restore wrote the WRONG suffix;
  exact nominal recipe needs confirmation.** Findings:
  - The RDF crossx reads `muon_pairs_pbpb_2X_part*_single_mu4_mindR_0_02_**res_cut_v2**.root`
    (RDFBasedHistFillingPbPb.cxx:18/24/49/55). `_res_cut_v2` ⟺ `resonance_cut_mode=2`
    (DimuonDataAlgCoreT.c:398-401). These `_res_cut_v2` files are the ones clobbered.
  - My restore used `run_pbpb_2X_nominal.sub`, which sets only `pbpb_run3_mu4_force_nominal=true`
    → `resonance_cut_mode` stays default 1 → suffix "" → it produced PARALLEL
    `muon_pairs_pbpb_2X_part*_single_mu4_mindR_0_02.root` (02:55-56) and did NOT restore the
    `_res_cut_v2` files. The `_res_cut_v2` files remain CLOBBERED (zombie/missing-trees from
    the original incident).
  - **Ambiguity:** no run script sets `resonance_cut_mode=2`; `_res_cut_v2` is auto-set only
    when `trigger_effcy_calc=true` (plain `run_pbpb_2X.sh`, no force_nominal), but that mode
    is documented to SKIP the resonance cut — conflicting with the earlier R&O that the
    nominal OS tree IS resonance-vetoed. So the exact original recipe (force_nominal+res2 vs
    plain-trigger_effcy) is not certain from the scripts.
  - **No published results affected:** the downstream `histograms_real_pairs_*` (crossx/R_AA
    histogram outputs) were NOT regenerated and remain intact; only the upstream muon_pairs
    ntuples are damaged, which matters only for FUTURE RDF re-runs.
  - **April `_backup_20260420` backups** exist only for pbpb24 (incomplete, older skim) → not
    a reliable restore source.
  - **Action in progress:** running a no-clobber validation test (pbpb23 part4,

    restore with that recipe. **Open question for user: confirm the exact recipe used to
    produce the nominal `_res_cut_v2` crossx ntuples on the May skim.**
  - Also: `run_pbpb_2X_nominal.sh` appear INCOMPLETE (don't set `resonance_cut_mode=2`), so
    they do NOT reproduce the crossx inputs — flag for fixing once recipe confirmed.

- 2026-06-23 — **T_mix fill DONE: mixed-event combinatoric template** — `/review-analysis-code` PASS iter 1
  (log `review-analysis-code-20260623-223706-mixed-event-tmix-fill.md`; all numbers MATCH). Added PUBLIC
  `mixed_event_template` sub-flag of `low_mass_template_calc`: when both set, SetIOPathsHook reads
  `muon_pairs_*_scrambled.root` (ScrambGen output) and TriggerModeSettings writes a distinct
  `*_template_fit_mixed_event.root`; the fill block is UNCHANGED (same 0-4 GeV OS+SS minv 1D+2D, PbPb per-ctr,
  efficiency-weighted — scrambled weight=1 → lumi·w_reco·w_trig, the 1/L scale absorbed by the floating N_C).
  New run scripts `run_template_fit_mixed_*.sh`. Ran all 4 → T_mix produced. **Verified:** OS minv SMOOTH, NO
  resonance peaks (pp J/ψ-ratio 0.99, pbpb23 ctr0_5 1.00 — confirms it read the scrambled input, not _no_res_cut);
  **SS≈OS** (pp SS/OS=0.999, area-norm shape dev 0.002; pbpb SS/OS≈1.03 per ctr) → **C_OS≈C_SS** (the 5b
  charge-symmetry input). Nominal + _no_res_cut template outputs UNTOUCHED. Stale "_no_res_cut" cout/run-script
  labels fixed. **T_mix ready → 5b coupled-fit closure (the gate).**
- 2026-06-23 — **ScrambGen REWRITTEN to the object model + scrambled muon_pairs produced** —
  `/review-analysis-code` PASS iter 2 (log `review-analysis-code-20260623-202339-scrambgen-objectmodel-rewrite.md`;
  all numbers MATCH). Replaced the 4 old non-compiling `ScrambGen/{ScrambGen,ScrambGenPP}.{c,h}` (retired
  `class Muon`) with header-only object-model classes: read `MuonObj` single-muon trees via TChain, bin by
  ev_centrality into 20 5% intervals (exclude <0), mix two muons from DIFFERENT events (`ev_num` differs) same
  interval, build `MuonPairPbPb` (m1/m2/year/weight=1/`Update()`), route `same_sign`→sign1(SS)/else sign2(OS),
  write `muon_pair_tree_sign1/sign2` branch `MuonPairObj`. NO physics cuts (RDF applies signal_cuts).
  oversample=5, fixed seed. New `run_scrambgen.sh`. Produced `muon_pairs_pbpb_20YY_single_mu4_scrambled.root`
  (1.9/1.4/3.7 GB) + `muon_pairs_pp_2024_2mu4_scrambled.root` (1.7 GB). **Verified:** SS≈OS (charge-symmetric
  combinatoric: yr23 7.046M/7.049M etc.); **OS minv = smooth continuum, NO J/ψ/φ peaks** (ratio 0.997/0.968 —
  the defining mixed-event correctness check); per-ctr population central-weighted.
  **BUG found+fixed (iter 1 CRITICAL):** yr25 `Update()` recomputes centrality from the pair `FCal_Et` (a mixed
  pair has none → all yr25 avg_centrality=−1, would be dropped by the RDF filter). Fix: set
  `avg_centrality=(m1.ev_centrality+m2.ev_centrality)/2` explicitly after `Update()` (Design-Decision
  resolution #4; no-op for yr23/24). Re-ran: yr25 mean=15.22, 0% at −1. **Open INFO for user:** `MuonPairPbPb.h:51`
  yr25 "centrality all-zeros→recalc-from-FCal" premise looks STALE (yr25 single-muon ev_centrality now valid,
  mean 15.48); nominal real pairs unaffected (real FCal valid), but worth revisiting globally later.
  **Scrambled muon_pairs ready → next: RDF mixed-event mode to fill T_mix → 5b closure.**
- 2026-06-23 — **5a folder + code RENAMED (user, descriptive naming).** `k_validation_5a_20260623/` →

  `OS_to_SS_factor_MC_truth_{minv,ptEta}.C` (+ matching function names, OUT paths, header comments, cout tags);
  `summary.md` retitled + macro refs updated; this doc's references updated. Re-ran both macros → identical plots
  (k_int=0.307816), old dir removed. Name reflects: MC-truth validation of the OS→SS correlated-bkg factor k
  (headline: constant/m-independent k FAILS, smooth k(m,pT,η) holds). The data-closure counterpart stays "5b".

  all numbers MATCH). New PUBLIC flag `low_mass_template_calc` (RDFBasedHistFillingData.h) → SetIOPathsHook
  (PP + both PbPb blocks) reads `_no_res_cut`, TriggerModeSettings appends `_template_fit` to the output;
  FillHistogramsCrossx early-return block fills `h1d_crossx_minv_0_4_{op,ss}_dsigma` + 2D

  pbpb23 ctr0_5 [0,1.06]=15950, J/ψ=21130 — all 0 under V1); SS smooth; nominal outputs UNTOUCHED.
  **INCIDENT+RECOVERY:** flag first placed PROTECTED → cling assignment silently failed → pp ran nominal mode
  (output_generic_hists=false) and overwrote the nominal pp output → made flag PUBLIC + restored nominal pp via
  the canonical nominal crossx (678KB, verified). Same root cause as the 2026-06-22 incident; LESSON: macro-set

  `review-plot-20260623-...-k-validation-5a-ptEta.md`; 6 re-extractions MATCH). From the 2D templates:
  **k vs pair pT stable ~0.30–0.32 (8–40 GeV) = k_int**, mild modelable rise to ~0.35–0.41 (46–68 GeV,
  bb̄ hardening), large low-stat errors >68 GeV; **k vs pair η flat ~0.31, symmetric** (outermost |η|>2.2
  bins ~0.48–0.50 = forward-acceptance-edge, low-stat, NOT instability); k(m) shape consistent across pT
  slices. ⇒ the per-R_AA-bin normalization k is STABLE (the m-dependence is the template shape) — favorable
  for the coupled fit. Plots `k_vs_pair_pt/eta.png`, `k_of_m_in_pt_slices.png` + `numbers_ptEta.txt` +

  (2) **ScrambGen single-muon-tree production safety VERIFIED** (background read-only subagent, scratch doc

  `output_single_muon_tree=true`+`pbpb_run3_mu4_force_nominal=true` (pbpb) / `trigger_mode=3` (pp) →
  `trigger_effcy_calc=FALSE`; output base name `single_muon_trees` ≠ `muon_pairs`
  (DimuonDataAlgCoreT.c:410) ⇒ **clobber structurally impossible**. May-skim inputs ready (pbpb 23/24/25
  parts 4/2/6, pp24 12); existing single_muon_trees STALE (Oct-2025, old naming) → production needed.

  **k_cc≈0.009 (no charge-flip, as expected)**; one_b_one_c genuinely empty under the signal selection
  (G≈bb+cc here); k_comb(m) rises 0.14→0.38 ENTIRELY because f_bb(m)=OS_bb/G_OS rises 0.31→0.78
  (cc̄ dilution at low mass). ⇒ constant-scalar k FAILS (SS/(k_int·G_OS) sweeps 0.45→1.25, ~3×); smooth
  k(m) valid & expected; robustness favorable (robust k_bb modulated by theory-sensitive f_bb, which the

  `*_mindR_0_02.root` and throws a descriptive runtime_error if absent (states V1 required,
  fallback removed). Trigger-efficiency `else` branches (V2 `_res_cut_v2` first) UNCHANGED in all
  three places. ACLiC-clean both classes (separate sessions; PP `.so` 16:09, PbPb `.so` 16:13).
  **No rerun needed:** for the May-2026 skim the nominal hook now selects the SAME V1 file it
  already preferred (V1 was first in the old candidate list), so crossx/R_AA output is bit-identical;
  the change only removes the dangerous silent-fallback path. Verified all 4 V1 nominal files exist
  (pp24 589M; pbpb 23/24/25 245/174/492M). Committed to master.

## Results & Observations

### k-VALIDATION (5a) — FIRST LOOK from existing integrated truth templates (2026-06-23) ###
Quick read of `G_SS/G_OS` from the pT/η-INTEGRATED `_sigsel` truth templates
(`histograms_pythia_5p36TeV_no_data_resonance_cuts.root`; G = flavor {bb,cc,one_b_one_c},
OS=sign2, SS=sign1). 50 bins, 0–4 GeV.
- **Integrated `k = G_SS/G_OS = 0.308`** — physically sensible (0<k<1; the bb̄ charge-flip
  fraction of the correlated background). For context: G_OS/S_OS = 0.176 (correlated bkg ≈ 18%
  of the OS single-b signal integral over 0–4 GeV).
- **`k(m)` is smooth but NOT constant:** rises monotonically ~0.14 (m≈0.2) → ~0.38 (m≈3.9),
  a ~2.7× variation. ⇒ `G_SS(m)` does NOT share a shape with `G_OS(m)`; a **single scalar k
  is NOT valid**, a smooth **k(m) function** trivially is. Physics: `k(m) ≈ k_bb·f_bb(m)` where
  f_bb = bb̄ fraction of G_OS(m); f_bb rises with minv (bb̄ heavier) while cc̄ (no charge-flip,
  k≈0) dominates low mass. So the m-dependence is DRIVEN by the cc̄:bb̄ mix — the theory-sensitive
  piece the doc flagged (§2). **Implication for the GATE:** the constant-scalar reading of "SS
  bkg = OS bkg × factor" FAILS; the gate hinges on whether a smooth, ROBUST k(m, pT, η) makes the
  combined fit usable (needs: bb̄-only vs cc̄-dilution decomposition for robustness; (pT,η)
  binning; and the 5b data closure). NOT yet a pass/fail — full 5a investigation pending.

### 5b CLOSURE — FIRST ATTEMPT (2026-06-23, pp24) — fit-setup issues, NOT a clean pass/fail ###
First coupled-fit closure macro (`closure_5b_OS_SS_kfactor_data_20260623/code/closure_5b_pp.C`): separate
linear-LS fits SS_data=N_C·T̂_mix+N_kG·Ĝ_SS over [1.08,4]; OS_data=N_S·Ŝ+N_C·T̂_mix+N_G·Ĝ_OS over [1.08,4]
masking J/ψ+ψ′. **Result (integrated):** k_data=N_kG/N_G=0.296±0.010 vs k_MC=0.308 (ratio 0.96 — PROMISING
on the physics) BUT **N_C came out NEGATIVE** (SS −562, OS −1353; unphysical) and χ²/ndf poor (OS=83). High-pT
bins erratic/degenerate. **Diagnosis (hypotheses):** (a) the [1.08,4] window removes the low-mass
combinatoric-dominated region that separates T_mix from G → degeneracy → large-cancellation (negative-N_C)
solution; (b) SEPARATE OS/SS fits give inconsistent N_C — should be a COUPLED fit with SHARED N_C anchored by
the clean, WIDE-range SS (SS has no resonances → fit [0.3,4]); (c) OS resonance leakage (smeared J/ψ tail
below the [2.85,3.3] mask) contaminates → needs wider mask or resonance templates (§3h). ⇒ NOT a closure
fail (k_data≈k_MC is encouraging); the fit MACHINERY needs development before the gate verdict. → /review-investigation.

### 5b CLOSURE — FINAL VERDICT: the GATE FAILS (2026-06-23, /review-investigation PASS iter 2) ###
After developing a proper COUPLED OS+SS fit (shared N_C, SS wide clean anchor [0.3,4], OS resonance-masked,
non-negative yields via NNLS), the closure does NOT close for pp24. **Decisive evidence (shape infeasibility):**
the data SS combinatoric D_SS peaks at m=**1.72 GeV then FALLS**, while BOTH background templates rise to high
mass (T_mix peaks 3.96, G_SS peaks 3.64) — **the data SS is SOFTER than both templates** (41/46 bins in [0.3,4]
lie outside the templates' [min,max] envelope). Therefore NO non-negative combination N_C·T_mix + N_kG·G_SS can
reproduce D_SS → the NNLS pins N_C=0 with χ²/ndf=368 (unphysical: SS is combinatoric-dominated yet the fit uses
zero combinatoric). Pearson: corr(D_SS,T_mix)=**0.40** (the mixed-event T_mix genuinely mismatches the data
combinatoric — it over-populates high mass, because the single-muon mixing pool is harder than the soft muons
in real low-mass b-decay pairs), corr(T_mix,G_SS)=0.89. Root causes: (1) mixed-event T_mix too hard; (2) data
softer than both bkg templates ⇒ the combined fit is infeasible as built. Deliverables in
`dimuon_data/plots/template_fitting/closure_5b_OS_SS_kfactor_data_20260623/` (numbers_pp{,_coupled}.txt;
DIAGNOSTIC_SS_shapes_degeneracy.png; closure_coupled overlays; macros). **GATE FAIL ⇒ STOPPED per the user's
gate condition.** Options for the user: **(A)** refine the mixed-event method (mix within pT/η classes so T_mix
matches the soft data combinatoric) then retry the combined fit; **(B)** switch to **code-set B = MC-only
separate SS/OS fits** (the pre-agreed fallback — avoids the data-driven combinatoric entirely); **(C)** keep
the combined fit with a large combinatoric-shape systematic. Recommendation: the T_mix mismatch is the
immediate blocker; (A) is the natural next try, but (B) is the robust fallback if (A) still struggles. (for the fitting agent — 1D minv templates, Step 4a) ###
**Files** (Pythia evgen truth, `_no_data_resonance_cuts` = the truth sample has NO
resonance veto, unlike OS data):
- 5.36 TeV (nominal): `/usatlas/u/yuhanguo/usatlasdata/pythia_truth_full_sample/pythia_5p36TeV/histograms_pythia_5p36TeV_no_data_resonance_cuts.root`
- 5.02 TeV (variant): `.../pythia_5TeV/histograms_pythia_5p02TeV_no_data_resonance_cuts.root` (regenerate if needed — Step 4a only reran 5.36)

**Histogram name pattern:** `h_minv_zoomin_sign{1|2}_<category>_sigsel`
- `sign1` = SS, `sign2` = OS (`reference_sign_convention`).
- 1D TH1D, var `truth_minv`, **50 bins, 0–4 GeV**. Weight = generator `weight` (SHAPE
  templates — area-normalize in the fit). Truth level (no reco/eff/unfolding).
- Selection applied: `truth_pair_pt>8 && m1.truth_charge*m1.truth_eta<2.2 &&
  m2.truth_charge*m2.truth_eta<2.2` (NO ΔR cut, NO minv window) — matches the
  ΔR-removed data spectra D_OS/D_SS.
- 32 histos = 2 signs × 16 categories (9 flavor + 7 origin).

**Flavor categories** (`<category>` ∈): `single_b`, `bb`, `cc`, `one_b_one_c`,
`resonance`, `resonance_contaminated`, `photon_splitting`, `drell_yan`, `other_flavors`.
**Origin categories**: `FC`, `gs_FSR`, `phs_FSR`, `GS_ISR_no_HS`, `gs_ISR_one_HS`,
`diff_GS_same_HS`, `others`. (origin = production mechanism of the both-open-HF subset.)

**Fit-component mapping (§2,§3b):** with the OS spectrum (`sign2`):
- `T_S` (signal) = `h_minv_zoomin_sign2_single_b_sigsel`.
- `T_G` (gluon-splitting / open-HF) = sum of `sign2_{bb,cc,one_b_one_c}_sigsel`
  (use the origin set `{gs_FSR,phs_FSR,GS_ISR_no_HS,gs_ISR_one_HS,diff_GS_same_HS,FC}`
  if FC vs GS must be separated; `FC` = flavor creation, the rest = gluon splitting).
- `R_r` (smeared resonances, §3 resonance treatment) relate to `sign2_{resonance,
  resonance_contaminated}_sigsel` — but those need the no-veto reco-smeared build, NOT
  these truth templates directly.
- SS analogues (`sign1_..._sigsel`) drive the k-ratio study (Step 5: k=G_SS/G_OS).
**Caveat:** these truth templates have NO resonance veto; the OS *data* does (R&O below).
The fit must mask the OS data veto windows ([0,1.06],[2.9,3.3],[3.55,3.8]) consistently.

- **OS muon-pair tree is RESONANCE-VETOED (OS-only); SS is NOT — affects the fit
  (found 2026-06-21).** The new PP OS spectrum is EXACTLY 0 in minv ∈ [0,1.06],
  [2.9,3.3], [3.55,3.8] GeV while SS is smooth across all 0–4. Root cause:
  `DimuonAlgCoreT::ResonanceTaggingImpl` (NTupleProcessingCode/DimuonAlgCoreT.c:128)
  removes resonance-tagged muons **only for `op_sign`** (`if(op_sign)`); SS pairs are
  never tagged. Veto windows = `pms.minv_cuts` (ParamsSet.h:404-407): **[0,1.06]**
  (ρ/ω/φ + sub-threshold), **[2.9,3.3]** (J/ψ 3.097), **[3.55,3.8]** (ψ(2S) 3.686),
  [9.08,10.5] (Υ, outside 0–4). The nominal crossx ntuples are the `_no_res` variant.
  **Implications for the fit (§3c/§3d):** (1) the OS continuum the histos cover IS
  S+C+G as modeled — the J/ψ/ψ(2S)/low-mass resonances the §3c veto would remove are
  already gone, so no extra J/ψ veto is needed; (2) OS−SS is only valid in
  OS-populated bins — the veto windows MUST be masked in BOTH OS and SS before any
  subtraction or fit (else OS−SS = −C−kG < 0 there); (3) to ever SEE the J/ψ in OS
  (e.g. a validation plot of the raw 0–4 spectrum) needs a no-veto ntuple pass
  (`trigger_effcy_calc=true` skips the resonance cut). The data histos themselves are
  correct as specified (no mass cut in the RDF; identical OS/SS filter — the asymmetry
  is purely the upstream tree).
- **Pythia truth minv templates — usability finding:** truth `minv_zoomin` (0–4 GeV,
  50 bins) IS filled & plotted per flavor AND origin category, OS+SS — but (1) stored
  as 2D `{pair_pt, minv_zoomin}` (needs a projection to 1D), and (2) filled on the raw
  `df_op`/`df_ss` with NO single-b kinematic selection (`df_op` has no kinematic Filter,
  BaseClass.cxx:59; fill loops apply only the category filter). So they are NOT
  drop-in usable as fit templates that match the data selection. Fix (later cycle):
  add a truth fill with the matching selection (pair_pt>8, per-muon q·η<2.2, **no ΔR
  cut**, no minv cut) producing 1D `minv_zoomin` per category, OS+SS.

## Remaining Work
- Truth templates ALSO binned in (pair pT, pair η) for the k(pT,η) study (check if
  Step 4a output is pT/η-integrated; add a binned fill if so) — §3c, Step 5a.
- k validation: 5a MC truth k(pT,η,minv) + 5b data closure (SS ?= C+k·G_OS) — the GATE.
- Resonance-leakage quantification (§3h, Step 5'); settle 2.6-vs-2.9 signal edge.
- Mixed-event combinatoric: revive+modify+rerun `ScrambGen/` (Step 6 prereq —
  swap mass veto for signal selection, reconcile flat-vs-MuonObj input, rerun May skim).
- Coupled OS+SS fitter; closure test.
- Signal acceptance 2D MC map (log pT bins, fit/interpolate); apply after fit (§3f).
- Efficiency-order structural change (trig→unfold→reco-truth) when real unfolding +
  3D truth-binned pair ε_reco land (§3e; roadmap Q4/task_05).
- Wire acceptance-corrected signal yield into crossx & R_AA, replacing OS−SS (§3g).
- Δp/p fake-muon removal coordination (task_07 / roadmap step 16).
- Systematics (k incl. cc̄:bb̄ & FE:GS, template shapes, mixed-event norm, resonance
  leakage, fit model, fiducial-vs-extrapolated).

## Latest Stage
**AUTONOMOUS IMPLEMENTATION APPROVED & UNDERWAY (2026-06-22).** User approved running
the full chain to a PRELIMINARY result with placeholder reco-eff + identity unfolding;
Δp/p deferred (needs π/K MC); start with reco-eff (DONE: verified, no change) & ScrambGen.

**Orchestration / dependency graph** (✅=done, ▶=in progress, ⏳=queued):
- ✅ **T0 reco-eff/acceptance boundary** — verified no double-count; acceptance owns
  pT>4/|η|<2.4 via the `h_cutAcceptance` cutflow denominator (Design Decisions).
- ✅ **T0 Δp/p deferred** — placeholder #9 + roadmap step 16 marked "needs π/K MC".
- ▶ **T1 ScrambGen mixed-event (Step 6 prereq)** — biggest item, two sub-tracks:
  - T1a produce centrality-binned single-muon trees (May skim) → Condor (long pole, run first/in background).
  - T1b rewrite ScrambGen to object model (Design Decisions) → `/review-analysis-code` (parallel with T1a Condor).
  - T1c regenerate `nScramb`; T1d run ScrambGen (Condor); T1e fill T_mix via RDF.
- ⏳ **T2 data + truth template REGEN without ΔR** — confirm other agent's 1D Pythia
  histos dropped ΔR + are (pT,η)-binned; refill data D_OS/D_SS if still ΔR>0.05.
- ⏳ **T3 signal-acceptance map** (log pT, cutflow denominator) — INDEPENDENT of ScrambGen,
  parallelizable; needs the cutflow-based A_sig fill → `/review-analysis-code`.
- ⏳ **T4 resonance templates** (no-veto OS pass) — INDEPENDENT.
- ⏳ **T5 k-validation 5a/5b** — needs T1e + T2.
- ⏳ **T6 combined OS+SS fitter** — needs T2 + T1e + T4.
- ⏳ **T7 wire into crossx/R_AA** — needs T6 + T3.

**✅ INCIDENT RESOLVED — zero result-impact (2026-06-22).** The pipeline investigation showed the
crossx reads the **hadded** `_mindR_0_02.root` (V1) and trig-eff reads the **hadded** `_res_cut_v2.root`
(V2). Both hadded files are INTACT (Jun 8–10, untouched by the incident; V1 OS=745k/526k/1.49M valid).
The single-muon-job clobber only hit the intermediate **V2 part** files (`_res_cut_v2_part*.root`),
which the RDF does NOT read (regenerate only if trig-eff is re-hadded from parts; trig-eff is done).
Root cause (protected `output_single_muon_tree`) FIXED + committed. The nominal "restore" was
unnecessary (hadded V1 was always fine) but harmless — it produced V1 part files. **Cleanup later
(non-urgent):** zombie `_res_cut_v2_part*` (regenerate on demand), spurious `_mindR_0_02_part*` (02:55),
`_res_cut_v2_test`, the parallel `_mindR_0_02.root` re-hadd if any.

**File-usage clarified:** PbPb crossx reads intact hadded V1 (correct nominal, photoproduction+V1
veto applied); pp on the new skim since 2026-06-22. The d4c1197 `minv_cuts_v2` narrowing is real but
only affects V2/trigger-eff and the (separate) template-fit path — NOT nominal V1.

**Design DECIDED (investigation):** keep nominal/crossx on **V1**; build the low-mass template fit as
a **SEPARATE pass reading `_no_res_cut`** (resonances present for φ/J/ψ templates). The Step 2/3
`h1d_crossx_minv_0_4_*` histos (filled from V1 nominal → OS resonance holes) are superseded; re-fill
from `_no_res_cut`. See Design Decisions + §3a.

**DONE this round (2026-06-22):** (a) **PP `SetIOPathsHook` fix** committed — `!trigger_effcy_calc`
→ V1 first (mirrors PbPb); ACLiC-clean; `/review-analysis-code` PASS. (b) **`_no_res_cut` May-skim
production COMPLETE** (clusters 42–45, all batches wrote output) + **hadded** to (sizes):
`pbpb_2023/muon_pairs_pbpb_2023_single_mu4_no_res_cut.root` (290M),
`pbpb_2024/...` (206M), `pbpb_2025/...` (581M), `pp_2024/muon_pairs_pp_2024_2mu4_no_res_cut.root` (863M).
Verified resonances PRESENT in OS (pbpb23 p1: J/ψ=7493, φ=582, low[0,1.06]=5197 — vs 0 under V1).
These are the inputs for the separate template-fit pass.

**▶ RESUMED 2026-06-23 — autonomous build APPROVED with a GATE (user directives 1–3).**
Three directives this session (see Design Decisions for each):
1. **Remove the `_res_cut_v2` nominal fallback** (PP + PbPb data RDF `SetIOPathsHook`) — nominal
   requires V1 `_mindR_0_02.root`, else throw. → `/review-analysis-code`. (Task #1.)
2. **Build the template-fit mode end-to-end → per-R_AA-bin signal yields wired into R_AA**, but
   deliver **k-validation + closure plot** (Step 5) as intermediate `/review-plot` results. GATE =
   `G_SS = k·G_OS` (full `SS = C + k·G_OS`): PASS → proceed autonomously & wire into R_AA; FAIL →
   STOP for user (fallback = MC-only separate SS/OS fits). Template fit is part of the nominal/crossx
   pipeline (its changes always rerun crossx + R_AA). (Tasks #2–#4.)
3. **Subagent scratch-doc procedure** in force for all delegated work.

**Execution ordering this session (critical path to the GATE):**
- **Step A (Task #1):** `_res_cut_v2` nominal fallback removal → `/review-analysis-code` → recompile.
- **Step B (Task #2 = T2):** template-fit mode reads `_no_res_cut`, re-fills 0–4 GeV OS+SS data
  spectra `D_OS/D_SS` (superseded V1 versions had resonance holes) + per-R_AA-bin minv; distinct
  output file; pipeline-integrated. → `/review-analysis-code`, rerun (reads existing `_no_res_cut`
  hadded ntuples).
- **Step C (Task #3 = T5a, FAST path to the gate):** MC truth-level k = G_SS/G_OS from Pythia truth
  G categories (`_bb`,`_cc`,`_one_b_one_c`; FSR gs + ISR FE together) binned in (pair pT, pair η,
  minv). Needs the truth-G minv ALSO (pT,η)-binned — check Step 4a output; add a binned truth fill
  if pT/η-integrated. Deliver k maps + projections → `/review-plot`. This is the structural MC read
  on whether `G_SS = k·G_OS` holds (necessary, not sufficient — 5b needed for the full ansatz).
- **Step D (long pole, parallel/background):** T1 single-muon-tree production (Condor) + ScrambGen
  object-model rewrite → mixed-event combinatoric template `T_mix`, prerequisite for **5b data
  closure** (`SS_data ?= C_mixed + k·G_OS`) and the coupled fitter. VERIFY the incident fixes
  (`output_single_muon_tree` public; `force_nominal`/`trigger_mode=3`) are in place BEFORE
  resubmitting any single-muon Condor fleet.
- **Step E (gate decision at 5b):** PASS → T4 resonance templates → T6 coupled fitter → T3 signal
  acceptance → T7 wire into crossx/R_AA. FAIL → STOP for user.

**PROGRESS 2026-06-23:** Step A DONE+committed (28757cd). Gate criterion CONFIRMED by user = k(m,pT,η)
function (not constant scalar); save validation to a dedicated folder; keep code-set (B) MC-only as a
future possibility (Design Decisions). **Step C / 5a m-dependence DONE** (/review-plot PASS; Progress Log
2026-06-23): k_bb robust ~0.5, k_cc≈0, k(m) rise = cc̄ dilution f_bb(m); constant-scalar disproven; smooth
k(m) valid; saved to `dimuon_data/plots/template_fitting/OS_to_SS_factor_validation_MC_truth_constant_k_20260623/`.
**USER GO-AHEAD 2026-06-23:** run the FULL chain end-to-end to R_AA with reviews, autonomously,
stopping ONLY if the 5b k(m,pT,η) closure fails. Binning decided: pair pT = `pair_pt_log_150`
(=`pT_bins_150`, 15 log bins 8–150 GeV, matches the R_AA pT axis); pair η = `pair_eta` (24 bins).
k-fill = add 2D `{pair_pt_log_150, minv_zoomin}` + `{pair_eta, minv_zoomin}` (signal-selected, `_sigsel`)
to `FillHistogramsTemplateMinvSignalRegion`. EXECUTION (parallel tracks): FG = (pT,η) truth-fill code
(/review-analysis-code) → recompile → rerun pythia truth → k(pT,η) plots (/review-plot). BG =
read-only verification of the ScrambGen single-muon-production incident fixes (scratch doc
`_sub_scrambgen_singlemuon_verify_1.md`; NO submit/git by the subagent — orchestrator owns those).

**STATUS 2026-06-23 (checkpoint — all 5b prerequisites DONE):**
- ✅ **Part 1** (`28757cd`): nominal RDF requires V1; `_res_cut_v2` fallback removed.
- ✅ **5a gate (MC truth)** (`671af99`, `53ebd1c`, `ff6c52d`): k STABLE per R_AA bin (k_int=0.308; k_bb≈0.5
  robust; k_cc≈0; k(pT)/k(η) flat ~0.31). Constant-scalar disproven; smooth k(m) valid. Gate-FAVORABLE. 2×/review-plot PASS.
- ✅ **(pT,η) truth k-fill** (`53ebd1c`): 2D templates for k(m,pT,η).
- ✅ **Single-muon production**: 24 Condor jobs done; ALL 24 parts valid (no zombies), 19.72M muon entries
  (`single_muon_trees_{pbpb_20YY,pp_2024}_part*_*_mindR_0_02.root`). Incident-safe (distinct filename).
- ✅ **T2 data refill** (`37c5de6`): `low_mass_template_calc` mode → D_OS/D_SS from `_no_res_cut`
  (`*_template_fit.root`, 1D + 2D pair pT/η, PbPb per-ctr). OS resonances present; nominal untouched. PASS.

**ACTIVE 2026-06-23 (user): (i) RENAME the 5a folder + code to a descriptive name, then (ii) ScrambGen rewrite.**
(i) `k_validation_5a_20260623/` → `OS_to_SS_factor_validation_MC_truth_constant_k_20260623/` (descriptive: it is the
MC-truth validation of the OS→SS correlated-background factor k, headline result = constant/m-independent k FAILS,
smooth k(m,pT,η) holds). Rename macros `k_validation_5a_{minv,ptEta}.C` → `OS_to_SS_factor_MC_truth_{minv,ptEta}.C`
(+ matching function names + OUT paths); update summary.md + this doc's references; re-run to verify identical plots.
(ii) Then the ScrambGen rewrite (below), continuing to R_AA, stopping only if the 5b closure fails.

**REMAINING to the 5b GATE (Task #4, in progress):**
1. ✅ **ScrambGen object-model REWRITE DONE** (`c31fb8b`, /review-analysis-code PASS iter 2). Scrambled
   muon_pairs produced for pbpb 23/24/25 + pp24 (`muon_pairs_*_scrambled.root`); OS minv smooth, no resonance
   peaks (mixing correct); yr25 avg_centrality bug fixed.
2. **Fill `T_mix` via the RDF** — a mixed-event mode that reads `muon_pairs_*_scrambled.root` and fills the
   SAME 0-4 GeV OS+SS minv histos (1D + 2D pair pT/η, PbPb per-ctr) as the T2 D_OS/D_SS, efficiency-weighted
   (w_reco·w_trig; the 1/L scale is absorbed in the floating N_C). Cleanest: extend `low_mass_template_calc`
   with a `mixed_event_template` sub-flag (scrambled input + distinct output). → /review-analysis-code.
3. **5b DATA closure = THE GATE.** Per coarse R_AA (pT,η) bin: (a) charge-symmetry C_OS≈C_SS from T_mix
   (already SS≈OS globally); (b) the coupled-fit closure — does SS_data ≈ N_C·T_mix + (k·G_OS) hold (fit SS
   with {T_mix, G_SS,MC}; OS with {S_MC, T_mix, G_OS,MC}; check N_C consistent OS↔SS and N_G,SS ≈ k·N_G,OS).
   This overlaps the coupled fitter (Step 6). Deliver closure overlays → /review-investigation + /review-plot.
   PASS → Part 2c (resonance templates §3h → finalize coupled fitter → signal acceptance → wire R_AA)
   autonomously; FAIL → STOP for user (consider code-set B, MC-only separate fits).

**STANDING DIRECTIVE (user, 2026-06-23): DO NOT STOP for checkpoints any more. Autonomously continue
through ALL remaining steps until everything is done and R_AA is FINALIZED. The ONLY stop condition is the
5b closure FAILING (then stop for the user's decision per the gate). Otherwise: T_mix fill → 5b closure →
[on PASS] resonance templates §3h → coupled fitter → signal acceptance → wire crossx/R_AA → finalize R_AA.
Keep the tracking-doc protocol (plan before, results after) and the /review-* loops throughout, but do not
pause to report between steps.**

**⛔ STOPPED AT THE GATE — 5b CLOSURE FAILED (2026-06-23).** Per the standing directive (only stop condition =
closure fail) and the Gate-driven-autonomy design decision, the autonomous run halts here for the USER's
decision. The combined OS+SS template fit does NOT close in data: the SS combinatoric (data) is SOFTER than
both the mixed-event T_mix (Pearson 0.40 vs data; over-populates high mass) and the MC G_SS — no non-negative
N_C·T_mix+N_kG·G_SS fits (N_C→0, χ²/ndf=368). Full verdict: R&O "5b CLOSURE — FINAL VERDICT" (/review-investigation
PASS iter 2). **USER OPTIONS:** (A) refine mixed-event (pT/η-class mixing to soften T_mix) + retry; (B) MC-only
separate fits = code-set B (pre-agreed fallback); (C) combined + large combinatoric-shape systematic.
**Everything upstream of the gate is DONE & committed and remains valid** (Part 1; 5a MC-truth k-validation —
favorable; (pT,η) truth k-fill; single-muon production; T2 data D_OS/D_SS; ScrambGen+T_mix). Acceptance (T3)
and the R_AA wiring (T7) are NOT started (they were gated on this). Resume once the user picks A/B/C.

**CHECKPOINT 2026-06-23 (ScrambGen done):** All infrastructure for the gate is now in place — data D_OS/D_SS
(`_no_res_cut`, T2), MC k-validation (5a, favorable), and the mixed-event combinatoric (ScrambGen). The
remaining gate machinery is the `T_mix` RDF fill (small) + the coupled OS+SS fit that IS the 5b closure test
(the decision point). Commits this session: 28757cd, 671af99, 53ebd1c, ff6c52d, e3b1c3a, 37c5de6, 06e5a63,
21547e9, c31fb8b.

**Next (remaining for the gate):**
1. **(pT,η)-binned truth fill** of the G categories (+ single_b) → /review-analysis-code → then k(m,pT,η)
   maps/projections → /review-plot (extends 5a to per-RAA-bin).
2. **T2 data refill from `_no_res_cut`** (template-fit mode) → /review-analysis-code (D_OS/D_SS for closure).
3. **ScrambGen mixed-event** (long pole: single-muon Condor production + object-model rewrite) — VERIFY the
   incident fixes first.
4. **5b DATA closure** `SS_data ?= C_mixed + k·G_OS` → /review-investigation + /review-plot = the FINAL gate.
   PASS → Part 2c (fitter → acceptance → wire R_AA) autonomously; FAIL → STOP for user (consider code-set B).

**Non-urgent cleanup (unchanged):** zombie `_res_cut_v2_part*` (regenerate only if trig-eff
re-hadded), spurious `_mindR_0_02_part*` + `_res_cut_v2_test` from the incident.
