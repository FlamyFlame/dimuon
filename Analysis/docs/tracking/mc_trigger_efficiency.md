# MC-Based Trigger Efficiency (mu4 / 2mu4)

**Mode:** Implementation. **Created:** 2026-07-10. **Session:** "MC-based trigger efficiency".
**Siblings:** `mu4_trig_effcy_implementation.md` (CLOSED — data-derived chain; top-level
equations, tag-and-probe ε^nc, D9 bias lesson, cross-term §3c inherited from there),
`mc_trigger_info_skim.md` (ACTIVE — produced the trigger-enabled MC NTUPs this doc consumes),
`analysis_roadmap_2026_06.md` Q4 (ΔR trigger-correlation correction).

---

## Objective

Use the trigger-enabled Run-3 MC skims (pp24 Pythia fullsim `_July2026`; PbPb23-conditions
HIJING overlay r17618 `_July2026`) to deliver the MC-based trigger-efficiency program:

1. **MC single-muon mu4 efficiency** ε_MC(pT, q·η) = P[muon fires mu4 | offline reco muon],
   validated against the data-derived tag-and-probe efficiency.
2. **Factorization cross-check:** does the presence of a second offline muon at distance ΔR
   change a muon's single-mu4 probability? (ΔR-binned singles efficiency.)
3. **The ΔR correlation correction** ε_ΔR(ΔR) for 2mu4 (= the mu4 cross-term), via inverse
   weighting on an unbiased (no-trigger-requirement) MC pair sample. This is the analysis
   deliverable that replaces the current dummy ε_ΔR ≡ 1 (roadmap Q4).

## Physics Procedure (AUTHORITATIVE)

### 1. Motivation

The analysis corrects yields by a per-pair trigger efficiency. The per-muon no-correlation
efficiency ε^nc(pT, q·η) is measured **from data** (tag-and-probe, kept as-is). The missing
ingredient is the **two-muon correlation**: whether the pair-level trigger probability
factorizes into the product/union of the two single-muon probabilities. In data this cannot
be measured without bias — the sample only exists because a muon trigger fired, so every
inverse-weighted denominator is depleted by P(at least one fires) = ε₁+ε₂−ε₁ε₂
(mu4_trig_effcy_implementation.md D9). The new MC skims store **every** event with the
trigger decision merely recorded (`StoreAllEvents` fix, mc_trigger_info_skim.md R1b), so MC
provides the unbiased sample data cannot.

MC's role is the **correlation (ratio) only**. The known MC L1 over-efficiency (per-leg
ε_L1^MC/ε_L1^data ≈ 1.13, largest in the turn-on; skim doc §8d) largely cancels in a ratio
but not in an absolute efficiency — so the data-derived ε^nc stays in the analysis, and Step 1
below is a *validation*, not a replacement.

### 2. Top-level equations

Per-pair trigger probability (inherited from mu4_trig_effcy_implementation.md):

- **PbPb, mu4 (union — at least one muon fires):**
  `P(pair | ΔR) = ε₁ + ε₂ − ε₁·ε₂·ε_ΔR^cross(ΔR)`
  where `ε_ΔR^cross(ΔR) = P(both fire | ΔR) / (ε₁ ε₂)` is the cross-term correction.
- **pp24, 2mu4 (product — both legs fire):**
  `P(pair | ΔR) = ε₁ · ε₂ · ε_ΔR^2mu4(ΔR)`
  — the 2mu4 correction IS the cross-term; no inclusion-exclusion.

with εᵢ = ε^nc(pTᵢ, q·ηᵢ), the single-muon mu4 efficiency of an isolated muon. The two
assumptions this doc measures/tests: (i) the singles terms ε₁, ε₂ carry **no** ΔR dependence
(Step 2 — critical for the PbPb union formula, whose linear terms cannot be absorbed into the
cross term); (ii) the correlation is a function of ΔR alone (checked via kinematic binning).

### 3. Step-by-step method

#### §3.1 MC single-muon mu4 efficiency + data comparison

- **What it measures:** ε_MC(pT, q·η) = P[muon is mu4-trigger-matched | offline reconstructed
  muon in MC]. Direct conditional probability — **no tag-and-probe needed**: the MC sample has
  no trigger selection, so every reconstructed muon enters the denominator unbiased.
- **Numerator condition:** the muon itself is matched to an HLT mu4 object (per-muon trigger
  matching branch), NOT the event-level chain decision (which the *other* muon could have fired).
- **Selection:** mirror the data-side measurement exactly — Tight WP, same fiducial cuts
  (pT > 4 GeV, |η| < 2.4), per-charge (μ⁺/μ⁻ separately; the toroid bends the charges
  oppositely, hence the q·η variable). MC weighted per pTHat slice (σ·ε_filt/N; isospin
  4:6:6:9 for pp fullsim).
- **Comparison target:** the data tag-and-probe ε^nc — P[2mu4 | offline pair, 1st muon passes
  mu4, ΔR > 0.8] in the 2nd muon's (pT, q·η) — pp24 data vs pp fullsim; PbPb data vs HIJING
  overlay.
- **Plots:** overlaid data-derived vs MC-derived 1D efficiencies in pT, η, φ (μ⁺ left panel,
  μ⁻ right panel); pT turn-on overlays in q·η bins.
- **Expected:** MC above data by ~10–15% per leg in the turn-on, converging on the plateau
  (L1 muon simulation lacks real RPC/TGC chamber inefficiency). The comparison establishes
  whether the residual is a smooth per-leg effect (cancels in the Step-3 ratio) or has
  localized (η, φ) structure (would need care).

#### §3.2 Factorization cross-check: ΔR-binned singles efficiency

- **What it tests:** the assumption that P[muon fires mu4] is a property of that muon's own
  (pT, q·η) only, unaffected by another offline muon at distance ΔR — i.e. that the ΔR
  correction lives ONLY in the cross/pair term.
- **Method:** for muons in MC **pairs** (no trigger requirement anywhere), measure
  P[muon mu4-matched | offline reco muon ∧ ∃ other offline reco muon at ΔR ∈ bin] in three
  ΔR bins: **0–0.2** (inside L1 RoI / MS-sector-sharing scale), **0.2–1.0** (intermediate),
  **1.0+** (isolated reference — must reproduce §3.1).
- **Why kinematic binning is essential:** small-ΔR pairs are kinematically special (boosted,
  higher pair pT), so an inclusive comparison confounds kinematic correlation with genuine
  trigger correlation. The comparison must be at fixed (pT, q·η).
- **Plots:** 1D pT and 1D q·η dependence, and pT in q·η bins — the 3 ΔR lines overlaid.
- **Interpretation:** lines agree at fixed kinematics ⇒ assumption holds; the PbPb union
  linear terms need no ΔR correction, and the data tag-and-probe ε^nc (measured at ΔR > 0.8)
  applies to close pairs. A small-ΔR deviation quantifies the L1 RoI-merging / sector-sharing
  effect on the singles level.

#### §3.3 ΔR correction via inverse weighting (the deliverable)

- **What it measures:** ε_ΔR(ΔR) = P(pair fires | ΔR) / (ε₁ ε₂), the genuine two-body trigger
  correlation. pp: numerator condition = pair passes 2mu4. PbPb: numerator condition = both
  muons mu4-matched (cross term).
- **Method (inverse weighting, mu4 doc §3c, now on an unbiased sample):**
  - Denominator: **all** MC reco pairs, no trigger requirement, unit weight.
  - Numerator: pairs satisfying the trigger condition, each weighted 1/(ε₁·ε₂) with
    εᵢ = **MC-derived** ε_MC(pTᵢ, q·ηᵢ) from §3.1, evaluated continuously at the exact
    (pT, q·η) (TF1 Eval, never resample-to-nearest).
  - Ratio vs ΔR = ε_ΔR(ΔR).
- **Why MC ε in the weights:** self-consistency. If the factorization were exact and the
  §3.1 fits perfect, the ratio would be 1 at every ΔR. Using data ε^nc would instead park the
  plateau at (ε_MC/ε_data)² ≈ 1.28, conflating per-leg normalization with correlation.
- **Diagnostics:** (1) **plateau at large ΔR** — well-separated muons occupy different
  detector regions, decisions must decorrelate; failure to flatten means residual kinematic
  mis-parameterization of ε_MC leaking in. (2) **plateau = 1** — an offset measures fit
  quality, not physics. The physical content is the small-ΔR shape relative to the plateau.
- **Application:** ε_ΔR multiplies ε₁ε₂ in the pp 2mu4 weight, and dresses the ε₁ε₂ cross
  term in the PbPb union weight (both data-derived ε's unchanged).

### 4. Negative constraints

- **NO trigger requirement on any denominator** (the whole point of the MC sample; D9 lesson).
  Any per-muon numerator uses that muon's own trigger match, never the event-level decision.
- **Do NOT replace the data-derived ε^nc in the analysis with ε_MC.** MC contributes the ΔR
  correlation ratio only; §3.1 is validation.
- **Do NOT weight §3.3 numerators with data-derived ε^nc** (breaks the plateau=1 diagnostic).
- **Do NOT read raw NTUPs standalone** — consume/extend ntuple-processing output per the
  provenance rule (new trigger branches → propagate via a processing mode/flag, distinct
  output suffix).
- This differs from **mu4_mu4noL1**: no requirement on the other muon anywhere in the singles
  efficiency (§3.1, §3.2).
- MC is always weighted (per-slice σ·ε_filt/N; pp isospin 4:6:6:9).
- **Menu caveat (systematic, not a bug):** overlay MC uses HLT menu `Dev_HI_run3_v1`
  (L1 `MC_HI_run3_v1`, TriggerValidation prescale set, all relevant chains PS=1) vs PbPb23
  data HLT `PhysicsP1_HI_run3_v1` (L1 `Physics_HI_run3_v1`, physics prescale sets) — data
  side verified 2026-07-10 from the local test AOD run 462240 (mc_trigger_info_skim.md R2).
  pp fullsim uses `PhysicsP1_pp_lowMu_run3_v1`. Record as a possible systematic on the ΔR
  correction.

## Context (condensed from siblings)

- **Samples (mc_trigger_info_skim.md, all validated 10 000 entries/NTUP, non-empty trigger
  branches):** pp24 fullsim = 24 NTUPs (4 isospin beams × 6 pTHat slices, DSIDs 802758–802781,
  r16578) in `~/usatlasdata/pythia_fullsim_test_sample/`; HIJING overlay = 6 NTUPs (r17618)
  in `~/usatlasdata/pythia_fullsim_hijing_overlay_test_sample/`. Full-statistics productions
  still in the pipeline — this doc's machinery reruns unchanged when they land.
- **Available branches:** event-level `b_HLT_*`; per-muon matching `muon_b_<chain>` (+ `_0_01`,
  `_V2`, `_V3`); dimuon `dimuon_b_<chain>_<dR>` + 8 per-leg branches
  `dimuon_b_HLT_2mu4_L12MU3V_mu{1,2}passLeg{1,2}_dR_*`. In MC, 2mu4 ⊆ mu4 and
  mu4_mu4noL1 ⊆ mu4 hold exactly (skim doc §8b).
- **Data-derived ε^nc (mu4 doc, Pipeline 2):** tag-and-probe P(2mu4 | mu4-tag, ΔR > 0.8),
  role-swap combined, fitted Fermi+log per (centrality, μ±, fine q·η bin), TF1s in
  `single_mu_effcy_pT_fit.root` (PbPb 23/24/25 + pp24).
- **D9 bias (why data failed):** on a mu4-selected sample every inv-weighted denominator is
  depleted by ε₁+ε₂−ε₁ε₂ (~1.3 low pT → 1.0 high pT), faking ΔR structure through kinematics;
  the pair-level "fix" (D6) was tautological. Cross-term code (§3c) was kept explicitly as the
  reference for unbiased MC — this doc is that use case.
- **Known MC/data trigger offset (skim doc §8d):** per-leg L1 ratio ≈ 1.13 (turn-on-dominated);
  MC/data ≈ 1.24–1.44 for 2mu4-needing-two-RoIs, ≈ 1.0–1.1 for one-RoI noL1 chain. Benign for
  a ratio-based correction; quantify as systematic.
- Current analysis status: crossx weights use w_trig = 1/(ε₁+ε₂−ε₁ε₂) (PbPb) and 1/(ε₁ε₂)
  (pp) with ε_ΔR ≡ 1 dummy (roadmap Q4).

## Scope

**In:** the three measurements above on both trigger-enabled MC families (pp fullsim → 2mu4;
HIJING overlay → mu4 cross-term vs PbPb data), the data-vs-MC comparison plots, and delivery
of ε_ΔR(ΔR) in a form the crossx weights can consume. Ntuple-processing extension (mode/flag)
to propagate the trigger branches.

**Out:** re-deriving the data tag-and-probe ε^nc; applying ε_ΔR to crossx/R_AA (follow-up once
the correction is validated); the full-statistics MC productions (rerun when they land).

## Design Decisions

### D1: pp is the primary tester; PbPb (overlay) is implemented+run but secondary (2026-07-10, user)
**Physics:** Two known limitations degrade the overlay-vs-data comparison quality:
(a) the overlay MC simulates the `Dev_HI_run3_v1` HLT menu with validation prescales while
PbPb23 data ran `PhysicsP1_HI_run3_v1` with physics prescales (verified from files, skim doc
R2); (b) the overlay TEST sample was produced with a single fixed vertex position instead of
the Gaussian sampling over 4 positions used in data-like production — vertex-z affects muon
trajectories through the trigger geometry. pp fullsim has neither issue at this severity.
**Decision:** validate the procedure and the MC trigger simulation primarily on pp
(pp24 fullsim vs pp24 data); run the full HI chain too, but interpret slightly larger MC-data
differences there as expected, not as failures of the method.

### D2: Overlay test sample compares ONLY to PbPb23 data, 0–5% centrality (2026-07-10, user)
**Physics:** The overlay test sample is generated with PbPb 2023 conditions and impact
parameter b ∈ 0–5 fm only ⇒ the sample is dominated by 0–5% centrality events. Comparing to
any other year or centrality class would mix detector conditions and occupancy regimes that
the sample does not represent.
**Test-sample-only caveat:** the upcoming full HIJING overlay production will cover all
centrality bins, use PbPb 2024 conditions, and the data-overlay will cover year-to-year
(2023–2026) variations — the centrality/year restriction lifts then.

### D3: Proceed with the pp fullsim slices already re-skimmed; skip in-flight ones (2026-07-10, user)
2 of the 24 pp fullsim `_July2026` grid jobs were still running at start of work. Use the
completed slices (weights are per-slice, so a missing slice biases nothing at fixed pTHat;
it only thins statistics in its pT range). Check `mc_trigger_info_skim.md` later for
completion and re-run the (cheap) downstream stages when all 24 are in. Not highest priority.

## Implementation Plan

*Work on dedicated git branch. pp first (D1), then PbPb overlay.*

1. [ ] **Discovery:** trigger-branch inventory in the new NTUPs; NTupleProcessingCode fullsim
   path (where pair/single-muon trees are filled, whether trigger fields exist in the structs);
   data-derived tag-and-probe outputs (pp24 + pbpb23 0–5%) to overlay against; pp `_July2026`
   completion status.
2. [ ] **NTuple-processing extension** (per provenance rule): a config mode/flag that
   propagates per-muon mu4 matching + pair-level 2mu4/per-leg decisions from the raw NTUPs
   into the muon-pair (and if needed single-muon) trees for the fullsim/overlay MC modes,
   distinct output suffix, never clobbering nominal. `/review-analysis-code` with §3.1–§3.3 +
   §4 in the task prompt.
3. [ ] **Run NTP** over pp fullsim (available slices, D3) → MC pair/single-muon trees with
   trigger info.
4. [ ] **Step 1 (§3.1) pp:** RDF filling + MC singles ε(pT, q·η) per charge; overlay vs pp24
   data tag-and-probe (pT/η/φ 1D, μ⁺ left | μ⁻ right; pT in q·η bins). `/review-analysis-code`
   + `/review-plot`.
5. [ ] **Step 2 (§3.2) pp:** ΔR-binned singles efficiency, 3 ΔR bins overlaid (pT, q·η,
   pT in q·η bins). `/review-plot`.
6. [ ] **Step 3 (§3.3) pp:** inverse-weighted ε_ΔR^2mu4(ΔR); plateau existence + plateau=1
   checks. `/review-plot`.
7. [ ] **Repeat 3–6 for HIJING overlay** (mu4 numerators; cross-term ε_ΔR^cross), comparing
   only to PbPb23 data 0–5% (D2).
8. [ ] **Bookkeeping:** roadmap Q4, INDEX scope, docs; merge branch.

## Progress Log

*(append-only)*

- 2026-07-10 — Doc created. Physics Procedure written from user specification + inheritance
  from `mu4_trig_effcy_implementation.md` (equations, §3c cross-term, D9) and
  `mc_trigger_info_skim.md` (samples, branches, R1b/R2/§8d). Presented to user for approval;
  no code yet.
- 2026-07-10 — Physics Procedure approved by user with constraints recorded as D1–D3
  (pp primary tester; overlay ↔ PbPb23 0–5% only; skip the 2 in-flight pp slices).
  Sibling alert: `hijing_overlay_det_response_band.md` (branch
  `fix/hijing-overlay-det-response`) has pending fixes to `PythiaFullSimExtras.c`
  (exclusive truth→reco matching; global-pair-tree double-fill) and the
  `hijing_overlay_pp24`→`hijing_overlay_pbpb23` naming change. Trigger-efficiency
  measurements here are reco-level ratios — unaffected by the truth-matching bug; the
  double-fill affects absolute yields of the global fullsim pair tree, so ratio
  measurements are safe, but per-pair trees used here must be checked for the double-fill
  (dedupe or use kin trees if absolute denominators matter — they don't for efficiencies,
  numerator and denominator double alike). Naming: this doc's overlay outputs adopt
  whatever `FullSimSampleType.h` provides at run time; coordinate at merge.

## Results & Observations

*(organized, mutable — empty)*

## Remaining Work

- Implementation Plan steps 1–8 (pp first, then overlay).
- Later: re-run downstream when the 2 in-flight pp slices land (D3) and when the full-stat
  productions arrive (all-centrality PbPb24-conditions overlay; lifts D2).

## Latest Stage

**2026-07-10 — Starting Implementation Plan step 1 (Discovery) on branch
`mc-trigger-efficiency`.** Plan: parallel read-only discovery of (a) NTupleProcessingCode
fullsim path + pair/single-muon tree structs, (b) NTUP trigger-branch inventory + pp skim
completion + data tag-and-probe output locations (pp24, pbpb23 0–5%). Then NTP extension
(step 2) per §4 provenance constraint.
