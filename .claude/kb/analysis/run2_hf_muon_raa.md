## Relevance to this analysis   (this is the paper OUR analysis is built upon)

OUR analysis (Run 3 single-b → **dimuon**) directly descends from this
single inclusive-HF-muon measurement. The two share the physics question
(b-quark in-medium energy loss via R_AA), much of the detector method
(muon selection, efficiency corrections, FCal/Glauber centrality, the
momentum-imbalance fake-muon separation), and the physics motivation
(dead-cone, mass-ordered energy loss). OUR value-add: (1) **dimuon pair
kinematics** (pair pT, pair η) give better kinematic control of the parent
b than one HF muon; (2) the **single-b dimuon** topology (low mass, small
opening angle) isolates b-decay products from c-hadron contamination →
flavour-pure signal *by selection*, instead of via this paper's per-muon
d0 template fit.

## Scope & condition-difference warnings

System/energy/dataset: **Run 2, √s_NN = 5.02 TeV.** pp = 2017, 1.17 pb⁻¹.
Pb+Pb = 2015 (208 µb⁻¹) + 2018 (38 µb⁻¹) = **246 µb⁻¹ combined**.

Differences from OUR analysis — **acknowledge; do NOT assume size or
direction (GUIDE §5):**
- **Run 2 5.02 TeV** here vs **Run 3 5.36 TeV** (pp24 + Pb+Pb 23/24/25) ours.
- **Single inclusive HF muon** here vs **single-b dimuon pair** ours.
  Their flavour separation is a per-muon d0 template fit; ours is a
  kinematic selection on the pair (low mass, small ΔR).
- **Trigger:** single **HLT_mu4** (L1+HLT pT>4 GeV) for both pp and Pb+Pb
  here; ours is PbPb single-mu4 and **pp24 2mu4** (different efficiency
  machinery).
- **Reconstruction efficiency:** here a **single-muon** efficiency,
  factorized ε(Medium|ID)·ε(ID|ME) from J/ψ/Z tag-and-probe. OURS is a
  **pair** efficiency in (pair pT, pair η, ΔR) from Pythia fullsim /
  HIJING overlay — *not* a product of single-muon efficiencies (see
  `project_pair_reco_effcy_definition`). These are fundamentally
  different objects.
- **Muon WP:** Medium (nominal) here; our nominal WP is unsettled
  (roadmap Q2.8).
- **Centrality:** Glauber with σ_NN = 70 mb at 5.02 TeV here; our PbPb
  uses σ_PbPb = 7.8 b at 5.36 TeV (roadmap Q2.2). T_AA values below are
  5.02 TeV and must NOT be reused for Run 3.

## Content summary

### Physics motivation  [background-for-writing]
Heavy quarks (c, b) are made in initial hard scatters, conserve flavour
(cannot be destroyed in the QGP, only have momenta modified), and probe
the QGP via radiative + collisional energy loss whose balance depends on
quark mass. Radiative loss is suppressed by the **dead-cone effect**
(gluon radiation suppressed at angles < m/E), more so for b than c at
equal momentum. Measuring c and b R_AA separately constrains the
mass-dependence of energy loss (§1). Joint R_AA + v2 (the latter from the
companion measurement, ref [25]) discriminates energy-loss mechanisms and
QGP-geometry effects.

### R_AA and yields  [method-we-use]
R_AA (Eq. 1):  **R_AA = (N_AA / N_evt) / (⟨T_AA⟩ × σ_pp)** , where N_AA =
observed muons in Pb+Pb, N_evt = number of min-bias Pb+Pb events,
⟨T_AA⟩ = mean nuclear thickness, σ_pp = pp production cross-section at the
same energy. R_AA = 1 ⇒ scaled pp; R_AA < 1 ⇒ suppression.
pp differential cross-section (Eq. 2): d²σ/dpT dη = N_corr /
(ΔpT·Δη·L_HLT_mu4). Pb+Pb per-event yield (Eq. 3): N_AA =
N_corr / (ΔpT·Δη·(N_evt^MB/L_MinBias)·L_HLT_mu4), with the trigger and
min-bias sampled luminosities cancelling. N_corr = background-subtracted
muon counts weighted per muon by **w = 1/(ε_reco·ε_trig)**.
(Internal note §4.1; N_evt^MB/L_MinBias = 7.383×10⁸ nb⁻¹ per 10%.)

### Event / muon selection  [background-for-writing]
Good event: detector-error flags clear, ≥1 primary vertex; Pb+Pb only:
\|Δt_MBTS\|<5 ns and FCal–ZDC / calo-Σtransverse-energy–nTrk pileup
rejection (rejects ~0.2%); HLT_mu4 fired. Muon: **Medium** WP
(TRT-hit requirement in pp only), **4 < pT < 30 GeV, \|η\| < 2**,
\|z0 sinθ\| < 1 mm, matched to online HLT_mu4 muon with ΔR < 0.01
(note §3.3).

### Centrality  [method-we-use (method)]
Per-event ΣE_T^FCal percentile, MC Glauber (σ_NN = 70 mb). Bins and
5.02 TeV Glauber values (note Table 5; T_AA in mb⁻¹):

| Centrality | ⟨N_part⟩ | ⟨T_AA⟩ [mb⁻¹] |
|---|---|---|
| 0–10%  | 358.8 | 23.35 |
| 10–20% | 264.1 | 14.33 |
| 20–30% | 189.2 | 8.64 |
| 30–40% | 131.4 | 4.95 |
| 40–60% | 70.5  | 1.96 |

### Background composition & two-step template fit  [method-we-use (ρ fit); background (d0)]
Selected muons (4<pT<30, \|η\|<2) = signal HF muons (c+b semileptonic) +
three backgrounds: **prompt-muon** (real muons from quarkonia, W/Z, τ —
fixed from simulation), **hadronic** (π/K decay-in-flight or punch-through
in the ID/calo), **fake** (random ID+MS segment combinations; fixed
relative to hadronic). Two discriminating variables, found uncorrelated
for signal, so the 2-D PDF factorizes (note Eq. 7–12):

1. **Momentum-imbalance fit.** ρ = (p_ID − p_MS)/p_ID (p_MS energy-loss
   corrected). Real (HF + prompt) muons: symmetric peak at ρ≈0; hadronic
   background: broad, shifted to positive ρ (energy loss not properly
   modelled). 4-component template fit (signal P_sig(ρ), hadronic
   P_had(ρ), fake P_fake(ρ), prompt fixed) — effectively 2 free
   components, since prompt and fake/hadronic ratio are externally fixed.
   Output: HF-muon yield separated from hadronic+fake. Templates from
   muon-filtered/non-diffractive **Pythia8** QCD at 5.02 TeV (A14,
   NNPDF23lo); muon momentum calibrated to data via shift Δp / smear δp
   factors from J/ψ→µµ invariant-mass response (note §4.4.1).
2. **d0 (impact-parameter) fit.** Within the fixed HF yield, charm vs
   bottom separated using the muon track transverse impact parameter d0
   (relative to the **beam spot**) — different B/D lifetimes (B≈1.5×10⁻¹²,
   D⁺≈1.0×10⁻¹², D⁰≈0.4×10⁻¹² s) give different d0 spreads. Two-component
   fit over **\|d0\| < 0.5 mm**; the single free parameter is the
   **bottom fraction f_b = κ_bottom/(κ_charm+κ_bottom)**. Bottom muons
   include the b→c→µ cascade. Signal d0 templates: muon-filtered Pythia8,
   reweighted to **FONLL** c/b-meson pT spectra, with baryon-to-meson and
   D⁺/D⁰ corrections; in Pb+Pb additionally reweighted to ALICE/CMS
   measured modified hadron spectra and built by overlaying Pythia8 onto
   2015 min-bias Pb+Pb events.

Prompt-muon background size: dominated by W decays at high pT — ~3% in pp
and ~10% (5%) in 0–10% (40–60%) Pb+Pb at 20<pT<30 GeV (Letter §4).

### Efficiency corrections  [background-for-writing (method reference)]
- **Reconstruction** (note §4.6): single-muon ε_reco = ε(Medium|ID) [MS
  reco+ID, "MS efficiency"] × ε(ID|ME) [ID efficiency], measured by
  J/ψ→µµ / Z tag-and-probe. pp efficiency from large **13 TeV** Muon-CP
  T&P maps, applied to 5.02 TeV (difference negligible, ~0.3%); MS eff
  plateaus ~97% at pT>7 GeV. Pb+Pb ID eff ~98% from Pb+Pb J/ψ T&P; Pb+Pb
  reco eff factorized as ε_pp × ε_PbPb(ID|ME)/ε_pp(ID|ME) (pp ID eff
  ≈100% so dropped). **No centrality dependence** observed for MS or ID
  reco efficiency.
- **Trigger** (note §4.5): central value from J/ψ→µµ (and Υ(nS)) Pythia8
  simulation tag-and-probe vs (pT, q·η); data/MC mismodelling corrected
  by a scale factor ≤10%. Pb+Pb adds a data-driven A_trig term (Pb+Pb/pp
  efficiency ratio) for online-momentum-scale and 2015↔2018 differences,
  as a function of pT, η, centrality, year.

### Systematic uncertainties  (Letter Table 1; ranges over pT & centrality)  [background-for-writing]

| Source | σ_pp c→µ [%] | σ_pp b→µ [%] | R_AA c→µ [%] | R_AA b→µ [%] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Muon efficiency | 0.5–1.0 | 0.4–0.6 | 0.3–16 | 0.2–16 |
| Background removal | 4.3–12 | 0.8–3.8 | 1.9–27 | 0.5–4.7 |
| Charm–bottom separation | 4.5–9.8 | 3.2–8.0 | 5.1–23 | 4.1–13 |
| Global normalization | 1.6 | 1.6 | 1.8–4.9 | 1.8–4.9 |
| **Total** | **5.8–13** | **3.1–7.4** | **6.5–35** | **5.4–18** |

Leading sources: background removal and charm–bottom separation
everywhere; muon efficiency also leads at low pT in central Pb+Pb. pp
luminosity uncertainty 1.6% (LUCID-2); ⟨T_AA⟩ from Glauber-parameter
variation. Some sources cancel partially in R_AA (pp↔Pb+Pb correlated).

### Results  [background-for-writing]
- **pp cross-sections vs FONLL:** b→µ (incl. b→c→µ) is 1.3–1.4× the FONLL
  central value but within its band at low pT, agreeing for pT>10 GeV;
  c→µ lies above FONLL at all pT, consistent within FONLL uncertainty
  below 10 GeV.
- **R_AA:** significant suppression of both c→µ and b→µ in all
  centralities; suppression increases monotonically peripheral→central.
  c→µ more suppressed than b→µ at low pT (<10 GeV) — mass-ordering
  consistent with dead-cone expectation. Charm R_AA ≈ flat in pT; bottom
  R_AA dips to ~10 GeV then flattens. Data compared with DREENA-B and
  DAB-MOD energy-loss models; joint with v2 from ref [25].
